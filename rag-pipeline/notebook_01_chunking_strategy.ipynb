The irony of our universal quest for Joy is the truth of our father’s philosophy that, in giving we receive; “A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.”\\n\\nWe wish you a blessed Christmas and pray that the New Year shall be fulfilling. May you give Love, Kindness and embed Purpose at the heart of your mission, and justly receive rewards of Joy, Peace and Contentment.\\n\\n    [link] =>\\n    [button2_link] =>\\n    [image_position] => left\\n    [media_width] => 50\\n    [is_milestone] => no\\n    [vertical_alignment] => top\\n    [section_title] => 85 Reserve\\n    [section_toggle] => on\\n    [section_overflow] => hidden\\n    [section_width] => full\\n    [section_height] => auto\\n    [section_animation] => off\\n    [background_type] => white\\n    [background_width_limit] => no\\n    [background_image] => Array\\n        (\\n            [image] =>\\n        )\\n\\n    [background_video] => Array\\n        (\\n            [video] =>\\n            [poster] =>\\n        )\\n\\n    [background_position] => Array\\n        (\\n            [pos_x] =>\\n            [pos_y] =>\\n            [pos_x_custom] =>\\n            [pos_y_custom] =>\\n        )\\n\\n    [background_parallax] => Array\\n        (\\n            [parallax] => no\\n            [speed] => 1\\n            [height] => 1.2\\n            [contain] => yes\\n        )\\n\\n    [background_opacity] => 1\\n    [background_brightness] => 1\\n    [overlay_type] => off\\n    [overlay_color] => primary-dark\\n    [overlay_opacity] => 0.85\\n    [overlay_height] => 85\\n    [font-colour] => black\\n)\\n```\\n\\n![Tea leaf teal background pattern](https://www.dilmahtea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tea-leaf-teal-background.png)\\n\\n## Making a Stand\\n\\nOur Founder, Merrill J.
