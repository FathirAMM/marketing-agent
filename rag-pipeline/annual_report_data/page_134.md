# EFFLUENTS

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 482, 328, 553]]<|/det|>
Dilmah's operations generate two main types of effluents: greywater (from handwashing stations, sinks, and showers) and blackwater (from toilet flushes and urinals).

# Effluent Management Approach

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 587, 340, 733]]<|/det|>
Dilmah is committed to manage effluents to ensure they do not pose a risk to the environment or surrounding communities.A formally documented effluent management procedure mandates full compliance with the discharge standards set out under the Environmental Protection License (EPL) issued by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) of Sri Lanka.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 752, 333, 869]]<|/det|>
Accordingly, all effluents are routed to an on-site wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which is equipped to treat wastewater to meet the specified environmental parameters. The plant ensures compliance with key quality metrics including pH, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 466, 622, 492]]<|/det|>
Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), oil and grease, and heavy metals.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 510, 618, 627]]<|/det|>
To ensure ongoing compliance, effluent quality is subjected to regular internal monitoring and testing, with results systematically recorded. In addition,external laboratory tests are carried out on a quarterly basis to validate the effectiveness of the treatment process and verify safe discharge.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 645, 625, 777]]<|/det|>
Following treatment, a significant proportion of the reclaimed water is reused for landscape irrigation,supporting Dilmah's green spaces and reducing freshwater demand. A dedicated fire well is also maintained,using a portion of the treated water as an emergency response resource for fire protection.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 796, 616, 881]]<|/det|>
All records related to effluent treatment,including treatment logs, test reports,and EPL compliance documents are maintained to ensure traceability,facilitate regulatory reporting, and support continuous improvement.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[652, 466, 910, 552]]<|/det|>
The wastewater treatment plant has a design capacity of 110 m3 per day, with typical daily throughput ranging from 60 to 70 m3, which equates to an estimated annual treated output of between 15,840 m3 and 18,480 m3.

# FIND YOUR INSPIRATION AT DILMAH

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[652, 586, 892, 611]]<|/det|>
**Spreading sustainability awareness among employees**

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[652, 616, 916, 732]]<|/det|>
The Find Your Inspiration at Dilmah initiative, is designed to enhance employee awareness of sustainability and circular economy concepts. Multiple projects have been conducted over the past years, and during the reporting year, "Sustainable Lifestyles" was selected as the central theme.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[652, 751, 912, 869]]<|/det|>
Under the selected theme, 'Seasonal Sustainability', a competition was organised featuring sustainable Christmas tree designs made from production waste. This initiative aimed to further encourage employees to adopt eco-conscious practices in their daily lives.
