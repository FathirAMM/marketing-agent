Dilmah is committed to keeping its teas entirely natural, preserving the inherent goodness that tea offers through its rich antioxidant properties. Believing that there is no better teamaker than nature itself, Dilmah nurtures the unique heritage of Camellia sinensis - real tea and the unique terroir of specific origins and in doing so offers genuinely authentic teas that honour the subtle variations of different regions and captures the natural goodness and distinctive character of various regions.

## Ethics & Sustainability  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[107, 689, 393, 870]]<|/det|>
Rejecting the commercialisation of ethics, Dilmah stays true to its Founder's Philosophy "to make his business a matter of human service" which was crystallised at a time when ethics and social responsibility were neither as much in the public eye as they are today, nor considered even to be among the responsibilities of business. In keeping with the philosophy of its founder, a minimum of \(15\%\) of Dilmah's global annual earnings are channeled to fund the work of the MJF Charitable Foundation and Dilmah conservation. The MJF Charitable Foundation has transformed thousands of lives through access to education, health, community development, care for the eldercare for the elderly and individuals with disabilities, with disabilities, while Dilmah Conservation works to safeguard biodiversity, promote sustainable agriculture, and inspire respect for the natural world.

Dilmah's passion for innovation aims to inspire a new generation of tea appreciation. As a pioneer in redefining the traditional perception of tea, Dilmah has consistently introduced bold, creative approaches to elevate the tea experience beyond the conventional. Signature initiatives such as Tea Gastronomy and Tea Mixology have reimagined tea as a versatile ingredient in fine dining and beverages, enabling chefs and mixologists worldwide to explore its complex flavours in unique and sophisticated ways. Another key aspect that reflects Dilmah's innovative spirit is the Tea Inspiration for the 21st Century, a groundbreaking concept that celebrates tea through culinary expression, pushing the boundaries of how tea is understood, served, and enjoyed.
