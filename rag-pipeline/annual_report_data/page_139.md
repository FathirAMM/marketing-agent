The Moratuwa Centre promotes sustainability through waste collection, segregation, recycling, rainwater harvesting for gardening (90 m² capacity), and a 15 m³ biogas system that converts kitchen waste into cooking fuel. Further the Centre promotes sustainable farming through hydroponics using organic inputs like vermivash and neem oil, and open-field cultivation with natural fertilisers such as compost, cow dung, and vermicompost—enhancing soil health, reducing chemical use, and improving water efficiency for environmentally friendly crop production.
