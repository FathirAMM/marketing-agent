Sri Lanka's growth trajectory is also likely to benefit from improved foreign exchange reserves, greater currency stability, and the sustained rebound in tourism and remittances. Additionally, the completion of external debt restructuring in December 2024 has created a more stable financial environment, allowing greater fiscal space for developmental spending and investment in growth- enabling sectors.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 319, 340, 470]]<|/det|>
However, the Country remains exposed to a range of external vulnerabilities, key among them are rising geopolitical tensions and an increasingly protectionist global trade environment. The introduction of new U.S. tariffs in March 2025, particularly on goods originating from Asia, could undermine the competitiveness of Sri Lanka's export sectors in key Western markets.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 485, 335, 621]]<|/det|>
To mitigate these challenges, Sri Lanka will need to aggressively diversify its export portfolio and expand access to non- traditional markets, while simultaneously working to strengthen bilateral and regional trade agreements, enhance ease of doing business, and attract greater foreign direct investment (FDI) over the medium to long term.

## GLOBAL TEA MARKET  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 652, 343, 892]]<|/det|>
The global tea market continues to expand steadily. The total global tea market was anticipated to reach USD 20.4 billion in 2024, with growth expected to continue at a CAGR of 5.7% through to 2034. This upward trajectory underscores the sustained global appetite for tea. The global tea bags segment, which was valued at USD 6.1 billion in 2021, is projected to double, reaching USD 12.9 billion by 2031. Black tea continues to dominate this segment, driven by a growing consumer base and increased awareness of its health benefits. With sales of black tea bags expected to grow from USD 1.7 billion in 2021 to USD 2.7

billion by 2031, the category remains a critical volume driver.

Likewise, consumer preferences towards value- added teas such as wellness infusions, premium blends, and ready- to- drink (RTD) formats are expected to grow exponentially over the next 5 to 10 years, reflecting a broader shift towards convenience, health- consciousness, and lifestyle alignment, particularly among millennial and Gen Z consumers.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 333, 630, 484]]<|/det|>
The commercial segment, which includes hotels, restaurants, and food service operators, is also projected to grow substantially, from USD 2.2 billion in 2021 to USD 5.1 billion by 2031, denoting a CAGR of 8.6%. This growth is driven by the rebound of out- of- home consumption post- pandemic and increasing demand for premium tea experiences in hospitality settings.

Against the backdrop of rapidly evolving consumer preferences, competition is set to intensify globally and continued success of brands will hinge on their ability to deliver differentiated offerings, and in particular sustainability- driven storytelling. In this environment, heritage brands like Dilmah, with its deep- rooted values of taste, goodness and purpose, is well- positioned to lead through innovation while retaining consumer trust.

## PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS FOR SRI LANKA'S TEA INDUSTRY  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 711, 624, 892]]<|/det|>
Once globally renowned for its unique terroir and quality, Sri Lanka's tea industry has seen its dominance eroded in recent years owing to a combination of internal policy missteps and external market dynamics. Poorly implemented restrictions on chemical fertiliser, compounded by adverse climate- related impacts, have severely impacted tea yields. As a result, international buyers and global tea brands are shifting towards alternative origin teas that offer

The global tea market continues to expand steadily. The total global tea market was anticipated to reach USD 20.4 billion in 2024, with growth expected to continue at a CAGR of 5.7% through to 2034

cost advantages and consistent supply. In response, even local exporters have been compelled to establish operations overseas, raising concerns about the dilution of Ceylon Tea's identity.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 470, 915, 635]]<|/det|>
While the recent depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee provided a short- term uplift to local tea prices, and global supply constraints allowed for opportunistic price hikes, this windfall may prove unsustainable. From a global buyer's perspective, Ceylon Tea has become increasingly expensive, particularly in USD terms, making it less attractive to price- sensitive, high- volume markets such as the Middle East and Russia.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 651, 915, 892]]<|/det|>
In this context, the long- term viability of Sri Lanka's tea sector rests on its ability to differentiate through quality, ethical sourcing, and value addition. Branding, storytelling, sustainability, and origin authenticity will be crucial levers. Furthermore, government support through bilateral trade agreements and industry- wide quality assurance will be essential to retain global market share. For a brand like Dilmah, which has always positioned itself on the platform of authenticity, integrity, and purpose, this evolving landscape presents a unique opportunity to lead from the front in shaping the future of Ceylon Tea.
