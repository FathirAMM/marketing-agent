Dilmah's commitment to Research and Development (R&D) is driven by a holistic approach that integrates product innovation, process optimisation, and sustainability, all anchored in a deep understanding of consumer needs and global market dynamics. R&D at Dilmah prioritises the creation of unique tea blends incorporating herbs, spices, and natural flavours to cater to niche markets and the growing demand for health- conscious options. These efforts are informed by comprehensive market and consumer research, enabling the development of teas that resonate with diverse demographics and evolving preferences, including wellness, organic, and ethically sourced products.

The company continuously refines its internal processes through data- driven decision- making and business intelligence systems. These tools provide valuable insights into operational, financial, and market data, helping improve strategic planning, efficiency, and performance monitoring. A key pillar of Dilmah's R&D strategy is sustainable packaging. Ongoing efforts focus on identifying alternative materials to reduce non- recyclable content and achieve \(100\%\) biodegradable packaging. These innovations have already led to minimalist, food- safe designs, with \(80\%\) of tea packs now featuring tear- strips that reduce material usage, enhance cost- efficiency, and minimise environmental impact.
