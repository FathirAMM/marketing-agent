implementation of a &#36;2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in March 2023, and the landmark completion of a &#36;25 billion external debt restructuring agreement in December 2024.

# INFLATION

Inflationary conditions in Sri Lanka eased substantially in 2024, marking a dramatic shift from the peak levels recorded in 2022. Having reached a high of 64% in 2022, inflation declined to just 0.5% by August 2024, before moving into deflationary territory at -1.7% by December and then stabilising within the target levels by March 2025.Rapid disinflation throughout the year helped alleviate cost pressures on both households and businesses and

The LKR appreciated steadily throughout 2024, supported by stronger macroeconomic fundamentals and improved investor sentiment alongside improved foreign exchange reserves and sustained inflows from tourism and worker remittances. In a move to further stabilise monetary conditions, the Central Bank introduced a unified policy interest rate of 8% in November 2024.This strategic measure played a pivotal role in anchoring inflation expectations,supporting the currency, and enhancing the attractiveness of Sri Lanka as an investment destination.

# BALANCE OF TRADE

Sri Lanka's trade deficit narrowed in 2024, reflecting a favourable shift in external sector dynamics. Export performance improved amid a gradual recovery in global demand and the competitive advantage of a relatively weaker rupee, which supported increased foreign earnings. At the same time, import expenditure moderated on the back of lower global commodity prices and ongoing restrictions on vehicle imports, contributing to a more balanced external trade position. This rebalancing played a crucial role in strengthening the country's current account and reinforcing external sector stability.
