## SUPPLIER DUE DILIGENCE 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 176, 340, 520]]<|/det|>
Dilmah's commitment to prevent child labour extends to the Company's third-party suppliers and partners across the value chain with regular assessments including on-site inspections, interviews, and document verification conducted to identify and mitigate any potential risks of child labour. If incidents of child labour are detected in the supply chain, the Company's "Child Labour Remediation Procedure" outlines a clear course of action to address the situation in a responsible and ethical manner. This includes immediate withdrawal of the child from hazardous work, provision of support to ensure their access to education, and engagement with the supplier to implement corrective measures. Continued non-compliance may lead to the termination of the business relationship. No incidents of Child labour have been reported during the reporting year.

While Dilmah fully supports the supplier right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, strong relations built between suppliers and Dilmah management have prevented the need for a formal collective bargaining agreement. Dilmah ensures that all employment within its supply chain is freely chosen, with workers free to leave as per agreed terms. No incidents of forced or involuntary labour have been reported.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 732, 334, 851]]<|/det|>
Dilmah expects all suppliers to uphold fair and respectful treatment of workers, without discrimination or harassment based on age, gender, religion, marital status, or any other protected characteristic. No incidents of discrimination or harassment have been reported within the supply chain.

Biannual supplier reviews are carried out by key departments that interact

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 140, 626, 259]]<|/det|>
directly with suppliers. These reviews assess performance across a range of criteria including quality, responsiveness, compliance, and alignment with the Company's sustainability values, enabling continuous improvement and informed decision-making across the supply chain.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 276, 625, 471]]<|/det|>
Moreover the digital supplier self-assessments introduced during the reporting year allow Dilmah to collect verifiable evidence of supplier practices, benchmarked against the expectations outlined in the Code. The responses will be reviewed and rated against a score card and where non-conformities or improvement areas are identified, they are addressed in collaboration with suppliers, supporting alignment with Dilmah's sustainability goals and overall supply chain integrity.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 487, 629, 666]]<|/det|>
Regular supplier audits, both physical and virtual are also performed based on the annual supplier audit plan to evaluate all key supply chain partners. The audits track supplier progress against identified improvement areas, with clear timelines and milestones. Where gaps are discovered, structured support is provided to help suppliers meet the required standards and achieve full alignment with the Company's ethical, quality, and sustainability expectations.

## SUPPLIER DEVELOPMENT

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 156, 923, 380]]<|/det|>
Recognising that capacity building is vital for building a sustainable and ethical supply chain, Dilmah offers structured training and capacity building programmes under its "Stronger Together" initiative. These sessions range from developing and initiating sustainability strategies to advanced topics such as measuring and reporting environmental impacts, including carbon and water footprints, life cycle analysis, and waste management. Human rights, child labour, Anti-bribery and Corruption (ABC), and emerging global regulations such as new EU directives are also key focus areas.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 397, 920, 530]]<|/det|>
In addition to training, the Company will also support its suppliers in their decarbonisation and humanitarian efforts by offering both financial and technical assistance. Furthermore, the Company will implement an online channel where suppliers can interact, exchange knowledge, and showcase their sustainability journeys.
