## Key Energy Efficiency Initiatives for 2024/25  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 269, 338, 509]]<|/det|>
- Installation of energy-efficient air conditioning systems to reduce cooling-related energy consumption.- Replacement of old air compressors with energy-efficient models, resulting in lower energy usage.- New conveyor belt systems introduced to minimise forklift use, reducing overall power consumption.- Replacement of two forklift batteries, achieving a \(20\%\) reduction in energy use for material handling.- Capacitor banks were installed to improve power factor and reduce  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[389, 137, 604, 181]]<|/det|>
reactive power losses, enhancing electrical efficiency and lowering operational costs.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 190, 622, 315]]<|/det|>
- Compressed air system optimisation, an ongoing project targeting \(10\%\) reduction in energy losses by minimising air leaks.- Installation of Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) for cooling tower motors to optimise pump energy use based on actual load, is another ongoing project targeting a \(20\%\) energy reduction.

## EMISSIONS  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 392, 608, 514]]<|/det|>
Since 2014, Dilmah has annually measured, reported, and verified its carbon footprint, with the emissions boundary encompassing all business operations under the Company's operational control, including both the parent entity and its subsidiary, MJF Beverages (Pvt) Ltd. An internally  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 137, 914, 211]]<|/det|>
developed emissions calculation manual details all relevant emission sources, designated focal points, data collection protocols, and calculation methodologies where:  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 220, 917, 391]]<|/det|>
Scope 1 & 2 emissions are calculated using \(100\%\) primary activity data. Scope 3 emissions are assessed using a mix of \(70\%\) primary data and \(30\%\) secondary data, based on spend- based and average data methodologies. Dilmah's current GHG inventory covers 14 out of 15 Scope 3 categories outlined in the GHG Protocol's Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 408, 917, 512]]<|/det|>
The assessment is conducted in accordance with internationally recognised standards, namely ISO 14064- 1:2018 and the GHG Protocol, and is independently verified with reasonable assurance against ISO 14064- 3:2019 by the Sri Lanka Climate Fund.
