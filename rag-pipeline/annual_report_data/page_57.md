## DILMAH'S APPROACH TO MANAGING RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 170, 333, 275]]<|/det|>
Dilmah recognises that effective risk and opportunity management is essential for sustaining long- term value creation and ensuring resilience in an evolving external environment. The overarching objectives of Dilmah's risk and opportunity management process are:  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 283, 323, 526]]<|/det|>

and opportunities in the market, regulatory, environmental, and social landscape  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 195, 629, 254]]<|/det|>
Strengthen corporate governance through consistent oversight, accountability, and alignment with the Company's risk appetite

## ENTERPRISE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT (EROM) FRAMEWORK  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 316, 629, 526]]<|/det|>
Dilmah has adopted the Enterprise Risk and Opportunity Management (EROM) framework to systematically manage risks and opportunities across all levels of the organisation. This framework is based on global best practices and tailored to suit the Company's unique operational context and stakeholder environment and allows Dilmah to anticipate, assess, and respond to uncertainties that may affect its ability to achieve its objectives, while also identifying and leveraging opportunities for innovation, growth, and sustainability.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[652, 138, 916, 242]]<|/det|>
Essentially, the EROM framework aims to ensure Dilmah remains resilient, and responsive to change by creating a firm foundation to safeguard current operations as well as strategically position the Company to thrive in a competitive and dynamic business environment.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[652, 259, 917, 530]]<|/det|>
As part of the ongoing enhancement of the EROM framework, Dilmah adopted the COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organisations) framework starting from the current financial year. In line with COSO framework, a comprehensive Process Risk Assessment was conducted followed by the establishment of a formal Risk Register to prioritise key risks based on probability, impact and overall risk score. Subsequently, a risk heat map was developed to visualise the areas of focus and to support decision- making. Additionally, new risk monitoring mechanisms were also introduced, including the integration of Enterprise Risk and Opportunity Management (EROM) with continuous internal audits.

## Risk Analysis  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 748, 310, 807]]<|/det|>
Involves assessing the sources, likelihood, consequences, and existing controls of identified risks to determine their significance  

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[201, 819, 308, 831]]<|/det|>
## Risk Evaluation  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[100, 834, 310, 894]]<|/det|>
