Memecylon elegantulum had been overlooked for decades, known only from limited material and previously treated as a synonym of M. rostratum in the Flora of Ceylon. Thanks to the dedicated fieldwork surrounding Dilmah's Endane Biodiversity Corridor project, its research team was able to confirm its distinct identity - validating it as a rare endemic angiosperms(flowering plants) of Sri Lanka.
