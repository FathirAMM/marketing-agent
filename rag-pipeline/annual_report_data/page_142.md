An ongoing conservation effort by Dilmah Conservation to restore 25 acres of degraded mangrove forest in Kappal Adi Lagoon, Kalpitiya. To that end, Dilmah has invested in an extensive mangrove plant nursery nurturing over saplings across 7 species. The use of science- based planting techniques have ensured an above average success rate in all planting activities that have been completed since its inception in October 2022.
