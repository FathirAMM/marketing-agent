## RISKS & REALITIES  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 439, 342, 620]]<|/det|>
The global tea industry remains challenging. Crisis related cost escalation and faint efforts at controlling food inflation in some territories resulted in intensified discount pressure. Too many tea companies yielded to that pressure. Our position remains that our teas carry with them the livelihoods of workers, biodiversity of our country and the promise my father made when he first launched Dilmah, making compromise in quality an impossibility.

In several traditional markets, changing demographics have produced declining volumes. Commoditisation pressures continue to undermine prices and margin sustainability, placing strain on producers. Recent supply disruptions- most notably within the global coffee industry- have highlighted the critical and enduring importance of genuine sustainability. These challenges are equally relevant to the tea industry, underscoring the need for resilient and future- focused value chains.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 138, 627, 243]]<|/det|>
Global warming is amongst the most significant threats to industry sustainability. Rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and increased occurrence of extreme weather events threaten crop yields and compromise the ecosystems on which fine tea depends.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 259, 628, 469]]<|/det|>
In Sri Lanka, these global trends have been amplified by local production challenges. Rising labour costs, stagnant productivity, an aging workforce, and the urgent need for industry modernisation remain core issues that require collective national attention. However, securing of Geographic Indication (GI) status for Ceylon Tea represents an important step towards protecting and strengthening our unique origin proposition on the global stage. We need to be aligned as an industry however, for this opportunity to deliver benefit to Ceylon Tea.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 485, 626, 560]]<|/det|>
Shipping disruptions and cost escalation, exacerbated by ongoing global conflicts, remain ongoing operational challenges, making agile procurement and supply chain management more important.

## STRENGTH IN SUSTAINABILITY - THE CORE OF DILMAH'S ADVANTAGE  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 607, 626, 756]]<|/det|>
Dilmah's ability to thrive through these complexities is fundamentally linked to its commitment to quality, ethics, and sustainability. The alignment of quality, manufacturing standards, genuine innovation, pricing and positioning in every market allows us to preserve quality at every stage while ensuring that the benefits of value addition fairly benefit producers and the tea industry.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 772, 626, 831]]<|/det|>
Our focus on genuine value and rejection of commoditisation allows us to preserve margin integrity while supporting fair wages and dignified livelihoods for our  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 138, 910, 198]]<|/det|>
suppliers and employees. Sustainability is not a trend but a consideration that is embedded into our operating model and long- term viability.  

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 214, 795, 227]]<|/det|>
## We invest directly in:  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 229, 912, 444]]<|/det|>
Ethical, traceable, and transparent sourcing and production. Climate resilience and biodiversity protection through reforestation and conservation science Inclusive community development with a special focus on youth, women, and the differently abled Employee development and leadership capacity building to ensure future generations of excellence  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 468, 913, 572]]<|/det|>
These commitments were formed decades before ethics and sustainability became a marketing tool for many brands. Conscious consumers are increasingly aligning with these values as they seek to do good through what they buy.

## GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL BACKDROP  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 619, 909, 739]]<|/det|>
The wider macroeconomic environment remained volatile throughout the year. Global conflicts - particularly in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and maritime choke points such as the Red Sea - disrupted shipping routes and exerted upward pressure on freight and input costs.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 755, 907, 829]]<|/det|>
Inflation, while moderating from recent peaks, continued to constrain consumer spending power in several key markets. At the same time, consumer behaviour continued to shift in favour of health
