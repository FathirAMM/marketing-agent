## RISKS, OPPORTUNITIES AND WAY FORWARD 

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 616, 123, 627]]<|/det|>
### Risks 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 630, 817, 643]]<|/det|>
- Rapid technology development may result in the obsolescence of machinery and equipment faster than expected 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 652, 904, 679]]<|/det|>
- Technology Integration demands re-skilling teams, fine-tuning processes, and ensuring compatibility with existing infrastructure, which could create transitional inefficiencies

### Opportunities 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 705, 535, 718]]<|/det|>
- Improve asset resilience by accelerating the transition to renewables

<table><tr><td>Short-Term (1 - 2 years)</td><td>Medium-Term (2 - 4 years)</td><td>Long-Term (4 - 5 years)</td></tr><tr><td>Transition from fossil fuel-powered vehicles to electric: 70% of the vehicle fleet, excluding those used for finished goods and raw material transport.</td><td>Replace existing solar panels with new, high-efficiency solar panels, which are expected to generate twice the energy of the current system.</td><td>Install 4000 kWp ground-mounted solar system as a major step in its asset decarbonisation strategy.</td></tr><tr><td>Install a 1200 kVA Online UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) system to ensure a stable, uninterrupted power supply and significantly reducing energy waste during machine start/stop cycles, which can consume three times more energy than normal operation.</td><td>Conversion of remaining C23 Tea Bag Packaging Machines to Knotted Thread-based packaging.</td><td></td></tr></table>
