Recognising training and development as a critical tool in building a skilled, adaptable, and future-ready workforce, Dilmah adopts a strategic and structured approach to meet both organisational and individual development needs, with a focus on enhancing technical expertise, strengthening soft skills, and supporting continuous professional growth across all employee categories. 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 342, 334, 565]]<|/det|>
Training needs are identified through a combination of departmental assessments and performance evaluations. Based on these insights, individual development plans are created to address competency gaps and align learning objectives with long-term career paths. On-the-job training is the primary learning method, which is further supported by targeted internal and external training, mentoring, and coaching. All training interventions are categorised into specific clusters to ensure clarity, consistency, and coherence.
