The emission intensity for the Dilmah Pellyiagoda premises is 7.55 metric tons of \(CO_{2}e\) per metric ton of tea produced,while the MJF Beverages facility in Rilhena records an intensity of 4.65 metric tons of \(CO_{2}e\) per litre of liquid tea produced.

In 2024/25, the organisation's total greenhouse gas emissions increased,primarily driven by a significant rise in Scope 3 emissions from 36,291.20 \(CO_{2}e\) in 2023/24 to 43,025.03 \(CO_{2}e\) , reflecting an increase of nearly 19%. This was largely influenced by higher emissions in Purchased Goods and Services, Capital Goods, and End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products. Notably, the increase in Capital Goods emissions is linked to the refurbishment of the office building,which involved substantial material use and energy-intensive construction activities. Scope 2 emissions, from purchased electricity, remained nearly constant. Overall, the data highlights the growing impact of indirect value chain activities on the company's carbon footprint.

At Dilmah, water is used primarily for sanitation and cleaning purposes. Water requirements are sourced from municipal water lines and on-site tube wells,depending on the location.

# Water Management Approach

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 714, 340, 862]]<|/det|>
Dilmah has integrated water stewardship into its broader sustainability agenda. Given that both operational sites -Pellyiagoda and Rilhena are located in high water-risk zones, as indicated by the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas (scoring between 3-4 on a 5-point scale), water management is designated as a key priority under the Company's Sustainability Strategy.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 374, 917, 445]]<|/det|>
Water saving is aggressively promoted through continuous improvement and awareness. As part of the overall approach, water consumption is continuously monitored across all major points of use including production facilities, utility operations,sanitation systems, and landscaping, with daily and monthly tracking to detect inefficiencies, identify potential leakages, and take timely corrective action.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 464, 915, 552]]<|/det|>
Additionally, Dilmah has committed to advance water sustainability through rainwater harvesting, recycling, and reuse. Accordingly, once used, wastewater is treated and repurposed, collected in a designated fire well and utilised for landscaping and gardening. Rainwater harvesting systems have also been installed at the Company's Headquarters, the One Earth Centre in Moratuwa, and selected tea estates under Kahawatte Plantations PLC, which collectively offer a harvesting capacity of 129,799 m3.

To scale up the company's rainwater harvesting infrastructure, preliminary feasibility studies were conducted by the Lanka Rain Water Harvesting Forum (LRWHF) in December 2024 at Endane and Houpe estates, with a view to expanding rainwater harvesting capacity across the Kahawatte Plantations footprint.

In 2024/25, Dilmah undertook its first-ever water footprint assessment in alignment with ISO 14046:2014, using the Water Footprint Network's methodology. This comprehensive evaluation was validated by a third party, marking a significant milestone in enhancing the accuracy and credibility of the Company's water performance data and reinforcing its commitment to sustainable resource management.
