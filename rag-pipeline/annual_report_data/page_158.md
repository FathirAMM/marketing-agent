Risk Management and Internal Control The Board of Dilmah holds overarching responsibility for ensuring that risk management and internal control frameworks remain effective, resilient, and aligned with the Company's strategic objectives. In fulfilling this duty, the Board defines the risk appetite and provides strategic oversight for the design and implementation of systems to identify, assess, and mitigate risks that may affect operational continuity, reputation, or financial performance.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 471, 337, 695]]<|/det|>
Operational execution of this mandate is delegated to the Board Audit Committee (BAC) with the support of the Head of Risk. The Head of Risk is tasked with implementing the Enterprise Risk and Opportunity Management (EROM) framework across all business units and acts as the primary liaison between first and second lines of defense to embed risk identification, evaluation, and mitigation processes throughout the organisation. This ensures that risk management is fully integrated into strategic planning and fosters a proactive, risk- aware culture.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 711, 343, 860]]<|/det|>
The BAC provides high level oversight by obtaining independent assurance from both internal and external auditors on the adequacy and integrity of the Company's risk and control systems. Where weaknesses are identified, the Committee recommends appropriate remedial actions to the Board to enable timely corrective measures and continuous improvement.
