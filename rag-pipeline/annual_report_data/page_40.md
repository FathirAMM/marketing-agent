The annual materiality assessment serves as the primary tool for identifying and prioritising the most significant Material Topics that inform Dilmah's strategic planning process and ensure that the Company remains responsive to both stakeholder expectations and emerging sustainability trends. The latest materiality assessment confirmed the continued relevance of the 19 Material Topics identified in the previous financial year.

- Impact Materiality: Examining how Dilmah's operations, products, and value chain activities affect the environment, society, and the communities in which it operates.- Financial Materiality: Assessing the potential implications of these same topics on the company's financial performance, long-term viability, and access to resources.
