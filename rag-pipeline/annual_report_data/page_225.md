Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet obligations as they fall due. The Group's approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or hindering the Group's operations.

The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through use of the Group's own reserves, funds from the shareholders and bank facilities.
