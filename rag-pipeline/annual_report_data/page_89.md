CULINARY INNOVATIONSDilmah has taken a proactive approach to counter the tea industry's growing trend of commoditisation by focusing on the value of premium- quality tea. The brand offers consumers pure, unblended tea that is carefully sourced, refined, and packed at its origin, ensuring an authentic and elevated tea experience. This commitment is reflected in various creative ventures such as tea- inspired gastronomy, mixology, and the groundbreaking "Tea Inspiration for the 21st Century" initiative. Beyond its own innovations, Dilmah actively supports external talent by organising and sponsoring events that provide a platform for emerging culinary creators to present their ideas. These efforts particularly target young chefs and mixologists, both in Sri Lanka and internationally. As a hub of knowledge and collaboration, Dilmah encourages engagement from a wide range of stakeholders, creating mutual value. By integrating external ideas and expertise, the brand not only enhances its own offerings but also fosters a thriving, sustainable environment for culinary creativity. The next section outlines key culinary innovations from the 2024/25 period.
