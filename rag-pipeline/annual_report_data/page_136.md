## Strengthening Circularity practices beyond business  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 170, 918, 245]]<|/det|>
As part of its commitment to go beyond business circularity, Dilmah drives sustainable innovation through initiatives like Ecovation and Climate Forward. These programmes empower youth and local inventors to develop practical, eco- friendly solutions in areas such as packaging, waste management, energy, agriculture, and water conservation. By providing mentorship, Seed funding opportunities, and exposure to investors, Dilmah fosters a culture of innovation that addresses pressing climate challenges while creating long- term environmental and social value.

DILMAHCONSERVATIONDilmah's commitment to biodiversity preservation is operationalised through its dedicated environmental arm - Dilmah Conservation (DC). Established in 2007 as an extension of the Company's founding philosophy of making business a matter of human service, DC drives initiatives that restore ecosystems, safeguard endangered species, and promote climate resilience. Central to these efforts are four DC hubs known as the Dilmah One Earth Centres, each focusing on specific thematic outcomes. These centres serve as platforms for research, education, and community engagement climate preparedness, in areas such as sustainable agriculture, environmental stewardship, and ecosystem protection.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 544, 900, 650]]<|/det|>
In addition to the One Earth Centres, DC also runs a variety of targeted conservation projects across Sri Lanka, addressing critical environmental concerns such as the protection of wetlands, mangroves, marine ecosystems, and native bee populations. These projects are implemented either directly through the One Earth Centres or via collaborative efforts reflecting Dilmah's integrated and scalable approach to environmental conservation. None of our operational sites are located in areas of high biodiversity.
