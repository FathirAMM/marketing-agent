## GRI 301-3 RECYCLED/RECLAIMED PACKAGING MATERIALS  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 173, 342, 414]]<|/det|>
Due to stringent food safety regulations and hygiene standards, Dilmah does not use reclaimed materials in direct food contact packaging, pose potential contamination risks and may compromise product quality. For similar reasons, recycled materials are not used in primary packaging. However, in line with Dilmah's commitment to promoting circularity wherever feasible, recycled materials are utilised in secondary and tertiary packaging. The primary objective of these efforts is to ensure that, after use, these packaging components remain compatible with established recycling systems.

Likewise packaging innovation is considered a key priority to support Dilmah's goal of achieving \(100\%\) biodegradable packaging that can be easily composted in both domestic and industrial environments. To that end, the Company dedicates significant resources annually to improve sustainability of packaging materials. For more

## GRI 302-1, 302-3, 302-4 ENERGY  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 199, 625, 258]]<|/det|>
As a value-added tea producer, Dilmah's operations rely on both non- renewable and renewable energy sources such as electricity, diesel, LP gas and solar energy.

## Energy Management Approach  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 289, 625, 514]]<|/det|>
Dilmah's energy management is guided by two pillars of its sustainability strategy: Climate Mitigation and Adaptation and Facilities, Buildings and Machinery. Under the "Climate Mitigation and Adaptation" pillar which focuses on renewable energy generation, Dilmah has taken significant steps to reduce its dependence on these sources by investing in building a solid renewable energy infrastructure base. Investments in solar energy to date with a total capacity of 635.5 kWp, generated 250,350 kWh of clean energy during the reporting year.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 530, 615, 559]]<|/det|>
Likewise, Dilmah has systematically increased its investment in hydropower  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 139, 916, 259]]<|/det|>
in group of companies since 2018 and today operates four hydropower plants: Queensberry (50 kW), Craighead (100 kW), Kataboola (128 kW), and Wellandura (80 kW), with a combined capacity of 358 kW. In the year under review, these plants collectively generated 402,466 kWh of hydropower.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 274, 911, 545]]<|/det|>
Meanwhile the "Facilities, Buildings and machinery" pillar focuses on the integration of energy- efficient technologies, infrastructure upgrades and regular monitoring to reduce energy intensity associated with non- renewable sources, ultimately lowering emissions. A key development during the year was the commissioning of a comprehensive Energy Monitoring System, designed to track and analyse energy usage across factory and office premises. This digital platform features detailed dashboards that provide online real- time data on energy use down to the equipment level, enabling the engineering team to promptly detect anomalies and take corrective action to improve efficiency.
