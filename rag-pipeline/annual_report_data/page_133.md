# Waste Management Approach

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 686, 333, 834], [366, 512, 630, 538]]<|/det|>
Dilmah adopts a structured and systematic approach to waste management, ensuring that all waste generated across its operations is handled in accordance with regulatory standards and industry best practices. Formally documented waste management procedures developed in line with global best practices, establish clear protocols for the management of the entire waste management lifecycle for various waste streams.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 557, 620, 720]]<|/det|>
These standard practices dictate that all waste is stored in designated secure areas, with secondary containment sites provided where needed to mitigate environmental risks. Additionally, waste is handled strictly by trained personnel using designated, clearly labelled containers to prevent cross-contamination, while emergency response procedures are in place to manage accidental spills.

Moreover, only authorised and licensed vendors are engaged for waste transportation, disposal, or recycling in compliance with environmental regulations. In parallel, Dilmah explores opportunities to collaborate with In 2024/25, Dilmah completed its first water footprint assessment aligned with ISO 14046:2014,validated by a third party-reinforcing its commitment to credible,sustainable water management.

specialist recyclers and environmental service providers to enhance the circularity of its operations.

All waste is tracked and recorded, while procedural compliance is verified through daily segregation checks at the source, routine inspections of storage areas,and comprehensive documentation of all waste collection and disposal activities. Quantitative tracking enables the identification of irregularities in waste volumes that require swift corrective action.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[652, 645, 917, 823]]<|/det|>
Regular internal audits are conducted to assess compliance with waste handling procedures, identify gaps, improve operational practices, and support alignment with ISO standards. Audit findings are thoroughly documented,and any corrective actions are tracked through to completion. Periodic waste audits are performed to evaluate types and quantities of waste generated and identify opportunities for reduction, reuse,or improved processing.
