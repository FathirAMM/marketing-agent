## SPECIAL WORKSHOP TO COMMEMORATE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[99, 185, 607, 260]]<|/det|>
To commemorate International Women's Day on March 8th 2025, Dilmah organised a special awareness session for all staff members in collaboration with the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs. The session, led by renowned speaker Mr. Sarath Wijesuriya, focused not only on women's empowerment but also on encouraging peaceful, fulfilling lives for both men and women.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[99, 274, 606, 364]]<|/det|>
The programme provided valuable insights on leading a happy, trouble- free life, strengthening relationships, and maintaining emotional well- being. It emphasised the importance of mutual respect, understanding, and balance in both personal and professional spheres. This initiative reflected Dilmah's ongoing efforts to nurture an inclusive, thoughtful, and supportive workplace culture for all employees.

As part of its continued commitment to empowering women within the workplace and beyond, Dilmah also conducted a series of targeted programmes aimed at supporting the personal, professional, and health- related development of its female workforce. These thoughtfully curated sessions addressed a broad range of themes, including: balancing work and family life; legal rights and protections for women; reproductive health and menstrual hygiene; awareness on communicable and non- communicable diseases; and strategies for enhancing productivity and personal effectiveness.

## TALENT DEVELOPMENT  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 554, 340, 718]]<|/det|>
Dilmah adopted a structured, data- driven approach to identify and strengthen critical job roles across the organisation. These roles are prioritised based on five key criteria: industry- wide scarcity, criticality to business continuity, the degree of technical specialisation required, the role's contribution to innovation and strategic growth, and its significance within succession planning frameworks.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 734, 335, 840]]<|/det|>
Talent development is undertaken based on the Skills Matrix which is developed based on the outcomes of the annual performance evaluation process. The purpose of the Skills Matrix assessment is to evaluate the technical competencies essential for each role,  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 538, 628, 625]]<|/det|>
along with their relative importance to organisational performance. Employees are assessed against these benchmarks to map existing competency levels, highlight skills gaps, and design targeted development interventions.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 642, 627, 824]]<|/det|>
In the year under review, Dilmah initiated preliminary arrangements to introduce a structured Leadership Development Programme in collaboration with a specialised external training partner. The main aim of the programme is to build key human- centric competencies such as adaptability, effective communication, emotional intelligence, resilience, and ethical leadership skills deemed critical for navigating the demands of a rapidly changing business landscape.
