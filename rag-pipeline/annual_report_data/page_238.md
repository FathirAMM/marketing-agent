The daily wastewater, including greywater and blackwater, is treated at an on-site plant in compliance with the Environmental Protection License (EPL).</td></tr></table><br><br>Treated water is used for irrigation of green spaces and stored in a fire well for emergency use. A dedicated officer oversees the wastewater treatment operations, ensuring effluent parameters such as chlorine and pH levels are monitored daily, with immediate adjustments made as needed to maintain compliance. Quarterly reports by an independent laboratory and bi-annual reports from the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) ensure ongoing adherence to environmental regulations.<br><br>In 2024/25, Dilmah undertook its first-ever water footprint assessment in alignment with ISO 14046:2014, using the Water Footprint Network&#x27;s methodology.
