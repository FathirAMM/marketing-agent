<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[126, 171, 914, 213]]<|/det|>

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible changes in the United States Dollars and Australian Dollars exchange rates by 10% and 15% with all other variables held constant, of the Group's/Company's profit due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities held as at reporting date. The effect of decreases in foreign exchange rates is expected to be equal and opposite to the effect of the increases shown.

### Equity Price Risk 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[126, 684, 891, 712]]<|/det|>
The Group's listed and unlisted equity securities are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the equity price and key assumptions used to fair value listed and unlisted equity securities. 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[126, 729, 889, 773]]<|/det|>
At the reporting date, the unlisted equity security is fair valued at Rs. 6 Mn (2024 - Rs. 12 Mn). The fair value of unquoted investment has been estimated considering the fair value of net assets held by investee as at 31 March 2025 and potential returns expected through its future operations. 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[126, 789, 884, 832]]<|/det|>
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the cumulative changes in fair value to reasonably possible changes in equity prices, with all other variables held constant. The effect of decreases in equity prices is expected to be equal and opposite to the effect of the increases shown.
