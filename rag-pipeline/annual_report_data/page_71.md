## ASSETS  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[368, 488, 620, 607]]<|/det|>
Dilmah's financial position strengthened further in the current year, supported by a significant increase in fixed assets. Overall Net Book Value (NBV) increased by LKR 2 billion of which approximately LKR 1.8 billion was on account of the acquisition of advanced tea bagging machinery.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[368, 622, 618, 756]]<|/det|>
Current assets increased against the build up of inventory levels to support Dilmah's market expansion strategies. Trade receivables remained tightly controlled and within the Company's internal target range, despite more competitive credit terms offered to grow captive market share from strategic customers.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[368, 772, 606, 862]]<|/det|>
Cash and bank balances declined by approximately LKR 2 billion during the year, driven by a strategic decision to convert short- term fixed deposits into longer- term financial instruments, in response to declining market interest  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 473, 910, 499]]<|/det|>
rates. The move led to a LKR 1.3 billion increase in other current financial assets.

## LIABILITIES  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 532, 914, 664]]<|/det|>
Dilmah maintained its disciplined financial position, with no significant increase in interest- bearing debt, thereby preserving its conservative capital structure. A key component of non- current liabilities remained the long- term lease liability, recognised in accordance with SLFRS 16 accounting standards for right- of- use assets.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 682, 915, 877]]<|/det|>
Trade payables increased in tandem with the Company's strategic decision to scale up production volumes and maintain a buffer of raw materials and packaging components to meet growing market demand. The increase was well- aligned with the pace of operational expansion and managed within acceptable limits. Overall, Dilmah's liability profile remains healthy and manageable, with strong internal controls ensuring that obligations are met without compromising liquidity or financial flexibility.
