## GRIEVANCE POLICY 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 178, 345, 370]]<|/det|>
Dilmah's Grievance Policy aims to ensure timely resolution of grievances. Employees who are dissatisfied or unable to resolve their grievances through other channels have the option to formally communicate grievances in writing directly to the Group Head of HR for investigation. All grievances are treated seriously and investigated thoroughly with resolutions provided in line with the timelines set out in the policy. There were no concerns raised through the formal grievance channel in the reporting year.

## ENGAGEMENT : 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 372, 628, 458]]<|/det|>
Dilmah fosters a culture of open communication, mutual respect, and employee engagement through multiple structured mechanisms that ensure every team member has the opportunity to be heard and valued: 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 476, 618, 519]]<|/det|>
- Employee Surveys and Feedback: Regular employee engagement surveys and feedback initiatives are 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[675, 140, 908, 228]]<|/det|>
conducted to capture insights on workplace experience. The findings are used to inform action plans, enhance employee satisfaction, and strengthen the overall organisational culture. 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 245, 915, 348]]<|/det|>
- Internal Communication Channels: The MJF Academy platform serves as a central communication hub for HR updates, learning resources, policy announcements, and company-wide news, promoting transparency and continuous engagement. 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 365, 911, 515]]<|/det|>
- Grievance Mechanism & Joint Consultative Committee (JCC) / Townhall Meetings: A formal grievance procedure, alongside regular JCC sessions and Town hall meetings, provides employees with accessible and transparent channels to voice concerns, share ideas, and participate in collaborative dialogue with management. 

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[94, 600, 335, 612]]<|/det|>
## JOINT CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[94, 616, 343, 720]]<|/det|>
A platform to facilitate ongoing dialogue between management and employee representatives, JCC meetings held every 3 months aim to empower employees to raise concerns, propose ideas, and participate in collaborative problem-solving efforts. 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[94, 737, 335, 871]]<|/det|>
While Dilmah fully supports the employees right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, strong relations built between employees and Dilmah management have prevented the need for a formal collective bargaining agreement. Hence Dilmah's operations are not at risk for collective bargaining.
