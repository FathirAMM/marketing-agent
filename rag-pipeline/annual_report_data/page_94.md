Notably, women represented \(35\%\) of leadership positions, a testament to Dilmah's commitment on advancing gender diversity in senior roles.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[98, 520, 399, 584]]<|/det|>
The Company upholds a 1:1 entry- level salary ratio for men and women and makes a deliberate effort to ensure equal pay for equal work across all levels.

# Prevention of Forced / Compulsory Labour  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[115, 771, 420, 875]]<|/det|>
In line with its Human Rights Policy, Dilmah maintains a zero- tolerance stance on all forms of forced or compulsory labour. The Company upholds the fundamental principle that employment must be freely chosen, and all employees have the right to leave their roles in accordance with the terms outlined in their employment contracts. Clear policies and procedures are in place to ensure full compliance with this commitment, and as such, no cases of forced or involuntary labour have occurred across any of Dilmah's operations.

# Prevention of Child Labour  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[508, 430, 897, 576]]<|/det|>
Dilmah is deeply committed to prevent child labour. The Company strictly complies with the minimum age regulations and has established stringent procedures to ensure that all new recruits meet the legal minimum age for employment. Dilmah's commitment to prevent child labour extends to the Company's third- party suppliers and partners across the value chain with regular assessments including on- site inspections, interviews, and document verification conducted to identify and mitigate any potential risks of child labour. If incidents of child labour are detected in the supply chain, the Company's "Child Labour Remediation Procedure" outlines a clear course of action to address the situation in a responsible and ethical manner. This includes immediate withdrawal of the child from hazardous work, provision of support to ensure their access to education, and engagement with the supplier to implement corrective measures. Continued non- compliance may lead to the termination of the business relationship.
