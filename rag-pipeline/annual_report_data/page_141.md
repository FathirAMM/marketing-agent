## ONE EARTH CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH CENTRE NAWALAPITIYA  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 500, 340, 741]]<|/det|>
The One Earth Climate Change Research Centre in Nawalapitiya is Sri Lanka's first private- sector Climate Change Research Station, established by Dilmah Conservation at Queensbury Estate in 2017. As a pioneering initiative, the centre plays a vital role in addressing the lack of scientific data on climate change in Sri Lanka. It has supported numerous groundbreaking research studies focused on understanding the impacts of climate change and developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, contributing significantly to national efforts in environmental resilience and sustainability.

## South Asian Nitrogen Hub  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[382, 182, 607, 286]]<|/det|>
The SANH (UKE) research project focuses on assessing the ecological impacts of ammonia through a controlled enhancement system established within a designated sampling plot.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[382, 303, 610, 390]]<|/det|>
A detailed lichen survey was conducted at the proximity of the research center and the impact of ammonia pollution was monitored through lichens as a bio indicator.

## Veddah community  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[672, 185, 888, 350]]<|/det|>
In 2024 a special workshop was conducted for the Veddah community to raise awareness about the negative impacts of traditional honey extraction practices from the forest. The session focused on guiding them toward sustainable beekeeping methods using bee boxes, aiming to preserve the environment while providing alternative livelihoods.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[672, 366, 895, 515]]<|/det|>
Building on these efforts in 2025, six members of the Veddah community were provided with bee boxes and essential beekeeping tools to commence practicing sustainable beekeeping, marking a successful step towards environmentally friendly and economically beneficial livelihood practices.
