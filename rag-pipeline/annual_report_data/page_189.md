The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

# 2.9.1 Capital Work-in-Progress

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 246, 340, 393]]<|/det|>
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost,net accumulated impairment losses, if any, which include all costs incurred from the date of acquisition to the date recognition criteria met to consider as property plant and equipment. Capital work-in-progress is transferred to the appropriate category under property,plant and equipment and depreciated over the estimated useful life.

# 2.10 Investment Property

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 426, 337, 590]]<|/det|>
Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.Investment property is measured at its cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 608, 337, 754]]<|/det|>
Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss in the period of derecognition.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 772, 340, 892], [367, 139, 621, 197]]<|/det|>
Transfers are made to or from investment property only when there is a change in use. For a transfer from investment property to owner-occupied property, the deemed cost for subsequent accounting is the fair value at the date of change in use. If owner-occupied property becomes an investment property, the Group accounts for such property in accordance with the policy stated under property, plant and equipment up to the date of change in use.

# 2.11 Intangible Assets

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 230, 625, 424]]<|/det|>
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition,intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.Internally generated intangibles,excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as finite.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 442, 627, 757]]<|/det|>
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 775, 625, 876]]<|/det|>
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss when the asset is derecognised.

# Research and Development Costs

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 157, 906, 227]]<|/det|>
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate:

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 237, 916, 428]]<|/det|>
·The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale·Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to use or sell the asset·How the asset will generate future economic benefits·The availability of resources to complete the asset·The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 448, 904, 641]]<|/det|>
Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amortised over the period of expected future benefit.Amortisation expense is recorded in the Statement of Profit or Loss. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.

# 2.12 Leases

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 830, 916, 886]]<|/det|>
The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified

Transfers are made to or from investment property only when there is a change in use. For a transfer from investment property to owner-occupied property, the deemed cost for subsequent accounting is the fair value at the date of change in use.
