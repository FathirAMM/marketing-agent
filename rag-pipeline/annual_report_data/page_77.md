## OPTIMISING ASSET PERFORMANCE 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 157, 343, 305]]<|/det|>
Dilmah's proactive approach to improving asset performance includes regular preventive maintenance and the use of digital tools for real-time asset monitoring to facilitate predictive maintenance. All machinery is maintained in line with detailed weekly, monthly, and annual schedules by the in-house engineering team, with technical advice sought from OEMs as needed.

The Group's engineering teams also engage in production efficiency and process improvement projects that focus on ensuring assets operate at peak efficiency to support higher productivity, lower downtimes and reduced operational costs.

Vehicle maintenance is also a key part of Dilmah's asset management strategy. All vehicles are serviced in line with defined schedules and service intervals, including daily inspections, quarterly comprehensive checks, and annual emission testing to ensure regulatory compliance and vehicle reliability.Heavy vehicle servicing and repairs are conducted at Dilmah's own maintenance workshop in Peliaygoda, while light vehicles are serviced through a network of approved external workshops and authorised dealers.

## OEE Improvement Project

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[382, 171, 877, 304]]<|/det|>
The OEE improvement project focused on increasing efficiency and minimising downtime across the packaging lines. A detailed analysis of equipment performance data was conducted to identify major loss areas, with particular emphasis on machine readiness and changeover times. The findings revealed the changeover process as the primary contributor to inefficiency, which led to a comprehensive review of manpower utilisation. To address underutilisation, workloads were reallocated resulting in the average changeover time reducing from 35-40 minutes to 25-30 minutes. The project also laid the groundwork for ongoing improvements through regular performance tracking and monitoring.

The SS implementation project was initiated to streamline the manufacturing floor, improve safety, and enhance operational efficiency. Through systematic sorting, unnecessary processes were eliminated; tools and materials were reorganised for quick access, while standard operating procedure's were established for all key areas. A scheduled audit plan was also drawn up and implemented to continuous improvement. The project also promoted a culture of cleanliness and discipline, supporting long-term continuous improvement.

## ASSET DECARBONISATION

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[371, 486, 905, 633]]<|/det|>
As part of the ongoing effort to enhance asset efficiency and sustainability of its operations, Dilmah continues to focus on reducing its carbon footprint through asset decarbonisation. In line with this commitment, Dilmah has obtained the validation of its Net-zero targets by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). A key part of achieving these targets involves purchasing energy-efficient machines, which lower energy consumption in production and reduce related emissions. Further advancing its efforts, a comprehensive Energy Monitoring System was implemented during the reporting year which enables the engineering team to detect irregular energy usage at the equipment level, allowing for immediate corrective action and supporting continuous improvements in energy efficiency.
