# GLOBAL ECONOMIC ROUNDUP 2024

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 157, 333, 303]]<|/det|>
In 2024, the global economy faced a marked deceleration, with growth easing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2023,denoting the third consecutive year of slowing momentum. The downturn was driven by a confluence of factors,including entrenched inflationary pressures, persistently high interest rates, geopolitical instability, and muted investment sentiment.

Growth particularly in advanced economies, moderated further, although the United States remained a notable outlier, posting an estimated 2.7%growth, supported by resilient consumer spending and a buoyant labour market.In contrast, the Euro Area's growth remained sluggish at 0.8%, weighed down by weak external demand and continued volatility in energy markets,stemming largely from the protracted Russia-Ukraine conflict. Japan also saw a decline in growth, which slowed to 0.9%,reflecting persistent structural constraints and subdued domestic demand.

Emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) fared relatively better, with projected growth of 3.9%.However, recovery in these economies remained uneven and constrained by high debt burdens, and heightened exposure to external shocks particularly those linked to climate change and

regional conflicts. Despite these headwinds however it appears that EMDEs are now playing an increasingly important role in sustaining global economic momentum.

# GLOBAL TRADE MOVEMENTS

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 246, 629, 409]]<|/det|>
Global trade remained lacklustre in 2024,continuing the downtrend observed in recent years. According to estimates by the World Trade Organisation (WTO),the volume of world merchandise trade grew by less than 1%, marking one of the weakest performances in over a decade.The underperformance was driven by a convergence of structural and cyclical headwinds that disrupted trade flows and dampened global demand.

Key among these were the persistent geopolitical tensions, most notably the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising friction between major trading blocs, which led to increased trade fragmentation. These developments not only heightened uncertainty but also prompted a strategic reconfiguration of supply chains, with many countries accelerating efforts towards nearshoring critical production capabilities. As a result, there was a notable deceleration in cross-border investment and intermediate goods trade, particularly in industries heavily dependent on global value chains, such as electronics,automotive, and textiles.

Additionally, the resurgence of protectionist trade policies in certain regions, including higher tariffs,export restrictions, and regulatory barriers, further constrained trade expansion. These inward-looking policies undermined multilateral trade frameworks, creating a more fragmented and unpredictable trading environment.

# INFLATION TRENDS

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 485, 906, 646]]<|/det|>
Global inflation rates declined significantly due to tighter monetary policies, the gradual resolution of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions,and falling energy and food prices.However, inflation did not retreat uniformly across regions, and central banks worldwide were compelled to navigate a delicate balancing act between supporting economic recovery and safeguarding price stability.

In advanced economies, headline inflation showed clearer signs of moderation. The United States, for instance, brought inflation close to its 2% target through a combination of sustained interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and cooling demand conditions. The Euro Area also experienced a decline in inflation, albeit at a slower pace, as energy price volatility subsided and wage pressures began to stabilise. Japan, in contrast, continued to battle low inflation momentum, underscoring structural deflationary tendencies in its economy despite moderate wage growth.
