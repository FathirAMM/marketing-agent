<table><tr><td colspan="2">Business Risks (BR)</td><td>Mitigation Strategies</td></tr><tr><td>BR3</td><td>Volatility in freight rates</td><td>The Israel/Palestine conflict caused a significant volatility in freight rates due to disruptions in key shipping routes, increased security risks, and heightened geopolitical uncertainty, leading to delays, rerouting of cargo, and increased insurance premiums, thereby escalating overall transportation costs and affecting supply chain reliability</td></tr><tr><td>BR4</td><td>Fluctuations in the cost of production</td><td>Volatile tea prices at local auctions are driven by a combination of inconsistent tea yields as well as political and economic factors</td></tr><tr><td>BR5</td><td>Issues relating to product responsibility and/or quality and safety</td><td>Issues relating to product responsibility and/or quality will directly impact Dilmah&#x27;s brand and reputation, thereby affecting its competitive edge</td></tr><tr><td>BR6</td><td>Competitor risk as global brands expand their RTD tea offerings.</td><td>Dilmah faces increasing competitive risk as global beverage giants expand their Ready-to-Drink (RTD) tea portfolios, capitalising on convenience-driven consumer preferences to gain market share. This growing competition may compel Dilmah to consider diversifying its product range beyond traditional black tea to remain competitive and relevant in evolving markets.</td></tr><tr><td>BR7</td><td>Changing customer preferences may challenge the relevance of Dilmah&#x27;s core products leading to loss of global market share.</td><td>A growing number of health conscious consumers are driving demand for teas with functional benefits, such as those promoting wellness and containing natural ingredients. Additionally, competition from alternative beverages like kombucha, specialty coffees and plant-based drinks has intensified, challenging traditional tea markets. Consumers are also becoming more sophisticated, seeking unique flavours, premium quality and ethical sourcing.</td></tr></table>
