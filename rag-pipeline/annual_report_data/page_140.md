## Agriculture Course for the Women Development programme of MJFCF  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[94, 181, 327, 407]]<|/det|>
An agriculture course to empower women with practical and income- generating skills. Participants received hands- on training in home gardening, waste management, nursery management, plant propagation techniques, disease identification and management, as well as ornamental flower cultivation. This comprehensive training aims to equip women with the knowledge and tools needed to not only support their households but also explore opportunities for sustainable income through agricultural practices.

## ONE EARTH FIELD STATION ENDANE

One EARTH FIELD STATION ENDANEThis Centre promotes nature- based agriculture, where tea plants are uprooted to facilitate restoration of a depleted ecosystem. Apart from this direct activity, the centre has adopted a multi- stakeholder approach to further strengthen restoration efforts. The centre also provides opportunities for local community members to gain a deeper understanding of sustainability principles by getting involved in various activities such as nursery management, organic farming, and beekeeping. Endane Biodiversity Corridor is the flagship project under this centre.

## REDISCOVERING A HIDDEN BOTANICAL GEM IN SRI LANKA - Memecylon elegantulum  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[381, 206, 728, 280]]<|/det|>
a newly published study titled "Reinstatement of Memecylon elegantulum (Melastomataceae) and recircumscription of Memecylon rostratum, two species endemic to Sri Lanka" has brought renewed hope to conservationists and researchers alike.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[381, 295, 884, 385]]<|/det|>
Memecylon elegantulum had been overlooked for decades, known only from limited material and previously treated as a synonym of M. rostratum in the Flora of Ceylon. Thanks to the dedicated fieldwork surrounding Dilmah's Endane Biodiversity Corridor project, its research team was able to confirm its distinct identity - validating it as a rare endemic angiosperms (flowering plants) of Sri Lanka.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[382, 400, 897, 460]]<|/det|>
The genus Memecylon remains one of the most under- studied plant groups in Sri Lanka, with many species being rare and poorly understood. This study provides detailed descriptions, typifications, and photographs of two such species that had long remained insufficiently known due to lack of field data.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[382, 475, 903, 536]]<|/det|>
This elegant member of the Melastomataceae family can now be recognised by its white flowers, long pedicels, and subtle morphological characters that set it apart from M. rostratum. This discovery was made possible through the floristic surveys surrounding the EBC project.

## Endane Biodiversity Corridor (EBC)  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 574, 618, 723]]<|/det|>
Endane Biodiversity Corridor (EBC)Initiated by Dilmah Founder Merrill J. Fernando, the Endane Biodiversity Corridor (EBC) stands as the flagship biodiversity restoration project under Dilmah Conservation. Launched in 2018, the project is jointly funded by Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company PLC and the Fondation Franklinia of Switzerland and is implemented in partnership with the Rajarata University of Sri Lanka.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 739, 615, 874]]<|/det|>
Managed under the stewardship of the One Earth Field Station - Endane, the project aims to restore ecological connectivity by converting degraded tea land into tropical lowland rainforest. To date, approximately 40 hectares have been successfully reforested, creating a vital corridor that links two separate forest reserves and facilitates  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 558, 910, 630]]<|/det|>
the migration of endemic and threatened species. A dedicated 5- hectare zone within the corridor has been earmarked for long- term restoration and ecological monitoring.
