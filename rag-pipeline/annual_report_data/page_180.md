# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 139, 341, 243]]<|/det|>
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 260, 334, 409]]<|/det|>
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 426, 325, 681]]<|/det|>
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
