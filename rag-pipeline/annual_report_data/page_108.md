## INCIDENT/ACCIDENT REPORTING  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 155, 907, 229]]<|/det|>
In the event of workplace accidents, incidents, or near misses, a clearly defined Accident, Incident and Near Miss Reporting and Investigation Procedure has been established, setting out the steps for prompt reporting, investigation, and response. The Manager - Health and Safety leads all investigations and is responsible for presenting findings and proposed corrective actions to the respective managers for implementation. Insights from these investigations are used to support continuous improvement and enable enhancements to safety protocols to help prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.

Accordingly, there were no work- related injuries or cases of work- related ill health recorded during the reporting period.
