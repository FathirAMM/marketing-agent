Dilmah Founder, Merrill J. Fernando devoted his life to tea in 1950. He dreamed of making the world a better tea, the finest quality, made ethically in the traditional, orthodox style, with kindness to people and nature. He fought vested interests and launched the first genuinely ethical, producer owned tea brand in 1985. Four decades later, united by his vision, the 2nd and 3rd generation of his family pursue his mission with the same uncompromising commitment to Quality, Integrity and Purpose.

![Dilmah Crest emblem](https://www.dilmahtea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dilmah-Crest-emblem-1280x987.png)

In 2025, we celebrate the legacy of our late Founder, reaffirming our commitment to the Quality, Integrity and Purpose that defined his lifetime of devotion to tea. Our [emblem](https://www.dilmahtea.com/family/emblem/) features our Founder, and a figure representing the artisans to whose welfare he dedicated himself. The shield symbolises the faith and determination with which he fought to overturn a colonial economic system. It also conveys the elements in his arsenal – respect for Nature, her influence upon Taste and Goodness, the Kindness that he embedded at the heart of Dilmah, and his passion for Tea. Above the shield is a Kandyan crown, adding our Founder’s love for Sri Lanka, and his entirely authentic mission to take our tea to the world.

> “We come into this world with nothing, we leave with nothing. The wealth that some of us acquire is owed to the efforts and cooperation of many others around us. Let us, therefore, share that wealth while we are still around, so that the goodwill and contentment created thereby may make our world a happier place for others too.”
