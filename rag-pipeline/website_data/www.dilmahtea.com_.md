## Blessed Christmas Wishes from the Dilmah Family 2025

It’s a sombre Christmas in Sri Lanka this year, yet a powerful one, as we all reflect on the true meaning of this special season. In stewarding our father’s legacy of kindness, we are richly blessed as a family and this is the truth we want to share this Christmas; life – and business – without purpose is meaningless. The irony of our universal quest for Joy is the truth of our father’s philosophy that, in giving we receive; “A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.”

We wish you a blessed Christmas and pray that the New Year shall be fulfilling. May you give Love, Kindness and embed Purpose at the heart of your mission, and justly receive rewards of Joy, Peace and Contentment.
