This policy governs the gifts that are exchanged, gifted or received by the employees of the organisation and is also applicable to gifts within the Company as well as between professional connections made on behalf of the Company. To ensure transparency, mitigate potential conflicts of interest, the Gift Policy identifies prohibited gifts as well as permissible gifts accompanied with clearly defined monetary limits for gifts that employees can give or accept in the course of their duties. Moreover, as per the policy, employees are required to report any gifts received regardless of their value, for documentation and review. As part of the annual policy review programme, the Board reviewed and updated all Conduct policies as needed to reflect latest regulatory developments and global best practices.

In 2024/25, several new initiatives were introduced to further reinforce IT governance structures, including the formalisation of key IT policies covering areas such as acceptable use, cloud adoption, remote access, and data classification. All policies were benchmarked against international standards to ensure consistency and effectiveness across the Company's digital ecosystem.
