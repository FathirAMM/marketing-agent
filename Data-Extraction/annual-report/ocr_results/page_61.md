<table><tr><td colspan="2">Financial Risks (FR)</td><td>Mitigation Strategies</td></tr><tr><td>FR1</td><td>Exchange<br>Rate Risk</td><td>Dilmah, being an export-oriented company, is inherently exposed to exchange rate risk, particularly in managing inward/outward remittances and financial assets. The company recorded a significant exchange gain during the year, in contrast to the exchange loss reported in the previous year. Given the relative weakness of the LKR against major currencies such as the USD and AUD, revenue from international sales remains vulnerable to conversion risk, especially under the mandatory currency conversion rules imposed by exchange control regulations</td></tr><tr><td>FR2</td><td>Interest Rate<br>Risk</td><td>Volatility in interest rates could impact Dilmah's cost of borrowing and financing</td></tr><tr><td>FR3</td><td>Credit Risk</td><td>The global economic downturn, characterised by reduced consumer spending, high inflation rates, and financial instability, impacted on the creditworthiness of both customers and suppliers. As many businesses and consumers faced financial strain, the likelihood of delayed payments or defaults increased, posing a risk to Dilmah's receivables</td></tr></table>
