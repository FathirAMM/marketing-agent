asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group considered whether:

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 223, 341, 355]]<|/det|>
·The contract involves the use of an identified asset. This may be specified explicitly or implicitly and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset.If the supplier has a substantive substation right, then the asset is not identified.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 366, 322, 424]]<|/det|>
·The Group has right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of asset throughout the period of use; and

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 435, 334, 596]]<|/det|>
·The Group has right to direct the use of the asset. The Group has this right when it has decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset if either:

·The Group has right to operate the asset; or

·The Group designated the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used.

# Group as the Lessor

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 722, 342, 882]]<|/det|>
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset is classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

# Group as the Lessee

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 156, 631, 259]]<|/det|>
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases,except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

<|ref|>title<|/ref|><|det|>[[368, 277, 512, 287]]<|/det|>
# (i) Right-of-use assets

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 294, 628, 595]]<|/det|>
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred,and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the lease term.The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment and are in the range of 3 to 36 years.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 612, 626, 715]]<|/det|>
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment.

# (ii) Lease liabilities

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 750, 620, 884], [652, 141, 914, 348]]<|/det|>
At the commencement date of the lease,the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[652, 366, 910, 652]]<|/det|>
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition,the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification,a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. (refer Note 7).

# (iii) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[652, 702, 911, 880]]<|/det|>
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
