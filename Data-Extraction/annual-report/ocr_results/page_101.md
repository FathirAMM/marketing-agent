An effective performance evaluation process plays a vital role in building a strong, capable, and committed workforce aligned with Dilmah's current and future needs. Hence the Company views performance evaluation not merely as an administrative exercise, but as a strategic tool to drive excellence, nurture talent, and cultivate a high performance culture.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 614, 338, 701]]<|/det|>
Striving to maintain fairness and consistency across the organisation,Dilmah employs a structured Performance Evaluation (PE) process to assess the performance and progress of all employee categories.

For executive-level employees,performance is assessed through the Employee Performance Management System, integrated within the Human Resource Information System (HRIS). This system evaluates performance based on clearly defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Key Behavioural Indicators (KBIs), with a strong emphasis on managerial competencies and alignment with Dilmah's core values. The process includes personalised one-on-one feedback discussions between employees and their reporting managers, aimed at recognising achievements,identifying development needs, and setting future goals.

Non-executive staff in clerical and allied roles participate in a formal appraisal process focused on assessing job-specific technical competencies. These evaluations also include individual review sessions that encourage open dialogue and support career progression within their functional areas.

For manual workers, Dilmah is currently rolling out a structured performance evaluation system via the HRIS platform.The first stage involves mapping role-specific skill requirements and developing tailored skill templates.Evaluations are then conducted based on these criteria, ensuring objective assessment and alignment with operational expectations.

The outcomes of the performance evaluation process are directly linked to Dilmah's reward and recognition mechanisms. All employees receive
