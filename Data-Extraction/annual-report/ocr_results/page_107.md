# HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 553, 333, 777]]<|/det|>
The Company's Health and Safety Management System contains a structured and proactive approach to hazard identification where the Manager - Health and Safety, together with the cross-functional OHS team,are responsible for conducting regular factory visits and walkthroughs to ensure compliance with established OHS policies and guidelines as well as to identify safety hazards. These inspections are supplemented by routine OHS team meetings where potential hazards are reviewed based on direct observations and employee feedback.

Employees are actively encouraged to report safety concerns or hazards they encounter in the course of their work. Monthly workers' meetings are

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 536, 612, 593]]<|/det|>
conducted with the active participation of the Production and Engineering departments, bringing together all operational team members.

The OHS team evaluates reported concerns and, where necessary,revises the risk profile to reflect changes in the working environment.To further strengthen this process, the Manager - Health and Safety conducts comprehensive hazard identification exercises by benchmarking against current industry best practices, OHS-related standards, and regulatory requirements. Outcomes from these reviews are used to update the Hazard Assessment Register and guide the implementation of appropriate risk control measures to reduce risk exposure to the lowest practicable level.

OHS Management System and risk assessment are also reviewed through periodic third-party audits carried out by SMETA.

In 2024/25, the Company identified several emerging risks, including those associated with the new conveyor system, production floor obstructions caused by power cords and compressed air lines, the need for improvements in the fire detection system, and risks related to electrical safety in production areas. Mitigating actions were promptly introduced, such as engineering modifications for obstruction, modification of fire detection system, and provision of high voltage personal protective equipment (PPE) for electrical work.These changes were documented in the updated Hazard Assessment to ensure ongoing vigilance.
