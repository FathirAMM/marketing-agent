<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 160, 905, 204]]<|/det|>
Dilmah adopts a proactive and inclusive approach to employee relations, underpinned by an open- door policy that encourages employees at all levels to engage directly with management. This policy fosters a culture of accessibility, trust, and openness, where employees feel comfortable voicing concerns or seeking clarification.

Meanwhile operational changes are communicated officially, via email for executives and through notice boards at factories for nonexecutives. The minimum notice period for significant operational changes varies depending on the nature of the activity. However, adequate time is always ensured to allow for proper adaptation to the changes.
