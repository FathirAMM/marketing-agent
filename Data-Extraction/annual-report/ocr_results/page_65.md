Dilmah strives to ensure its strategy remains highly relevant and adaptable amidst rapidly evolving macroeconomic conditions locally and globally. To ensure continued relevance and resilience, Dilmah undertakes a continuous refinement of its strategy, using insights drawn from internal strengths and weaknesses alongside external opportunities and threats. These findings are systematically mapped against Porter's Five Forces to understand the evolving industry landscape.

This integrated strategic assessment has shaped Dilmah's robust four- pillar strategy, which focuses on mobilising the right forms of capital financial, intellectual, human, natural, and social, to effectively navigate current challenges and leverage future opportunities, in turn enabling the Company to meet near- term performance targets and building resilience while advancing long- term value creation.
