By contrast, inflation in many EMDEs remained elevated due to a combination of factors, including currency weakening against the US dollar, in turn pushing up energy and food import costs, especially for net- importing countries.

Commodity markets in 2024 were shaped by cyclical easing and persistent structural challenges. Energy prices,particularly crude oil, trended downward over the year, with Brent crude averaging around USD 80 per barrel, largely driven by a combination of relative oversupply, moderating global demand,and strategic production adjustments by key oil-exporting countries. Despite this softening, volatility persisted due to geopolitical uncertainties and shifting OPEC+ dynamics.

Global food prices also recorded a notable decline of approximately 8.5%,offering some relief to consumers and alleviating pressure on inflation in food-importing nations. The easing in food prices was underpinned by improved harvests in key producing regions and stabilising global logistics networks.However, the overall commodity price index remained nearly 30% above pre-pandemic levels, underscoring the enduring impact of climate-related disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and structural inefficiencies in global supply chains.

# GLOBAL OUTLOOK FOR 2025

The global economic outlook for 2025 indicates signs of stabilisation but is expected to be overshadowed by escalating trade tensions and an alarming increase in geopolitical instability in recent months.

According to the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects (January 2025),global growth is projected to remain steady at 2.7% in both 2025 and 2026,indicating a normalisation of economic activity at a lower trajectory than the pre-pandemic average. This signals a transition into an era of modest, but stable expansion. Growth in advanced economies is forecast to moderate to 1.5%, weighed down by subdued domestic demand and tightened financial conditions. In contrast, emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) are expected to maintain momentum with projected growth of approximately 4%, supported by resilient consumption and gradual structural reforms. On the inflation front, global price pressures are expected to ease gradually in 2025,but remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels creating a conducive environment for central banks to consider interest rate adjustments that support investment and growth, without compromising inflation control.

Notably, a major source of downside risk to the global outlook stems from the United States' implementation of steep tariff increases in March 2025, raising rates up to 145% on Chinese imports and imposing significant duties on other key trading partners. These protectionist measures are expected to trigger a sharper contraction in global trade, and cause severe disruptions to global supply chains. Moreover with bilateral trade between the U.S. and China expected to deteriorate sharply, forecasts point to a potential collapse in volumes that could have long-term implications for global economic integration.

In response, several economies are expected to focus on diversifying trade partnerships to reduce dependence on traditional trade corridors. The United Kingdom and India have finalised new trade agreements, while the European Union is actively pursuing regional agreements to bolster its economic resilience, collectively signalling a fundamental realignment in global trade architecture and rewriting the global commerce trajectory in the years to come.

Recovery was underpinned by robust performance across several key sectors.The industrial sector experienced a notable revival, supported by an uninterrupted energy supply and a rebound in domestic demand. The tourism sector also gained substantial ground, benefiting from improved political stability and strategic destination marketing efforts. Meanwhile, the services sector, particularly IT and business process outsourcing,expanded steadily, fuelled by favourable exchange rate dynamics and rising global demand for remote services.The country's macroeconomic stability was further reinforced by the successful
