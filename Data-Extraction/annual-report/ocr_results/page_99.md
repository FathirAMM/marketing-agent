Performance also plays a key role in shaping compensation. Annual increments are awarded based on individual performance ratings, ensuring that employees are recognised and rewarded for their contributions.

For manual operators, salaries are guided by the minimum wage stipulations outlined by the respective Wages Board Ordinances. While aligned with regulatory requirements, Dilmah goes beyond compliance by benchmarking wages against industry standards. Findings from the latest market survey revealed that the Company's minimum wages are as almost as double the local minimal wage, underscoring Dilmah's ongoing commitment to providing fair and competitive compensation across all employee categories.
