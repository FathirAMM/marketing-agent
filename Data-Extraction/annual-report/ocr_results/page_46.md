## PURPOSE-LED ACTION  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 364, 341, 423]]<|/det|>
Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company's approach to sustainability is anchored by its founding values of Taste, Goodness, and Purpose.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 439, 341, 499]]<|/det|>
These values are embodied in the Company's Beyond Business philosophy, which recognises that the true value of a brand lies not only in the excellence of its  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 139, 627, 350]]<|/det|>
products but also in the positive impact it generates for people and the planet. Despite severe economic conditions in its home country and ongoing challenges in global markets, Dilmah has continued to sustain its operations and profitability while maintaining a strong, positive influence on the environment and society. This has been achieved through a steadfast commitment to sustainable practices — minimising environmental impact, upholding social responsibility, and adhering to the highest ethical business standards.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 365, 625, 500]]<|/det|>
This integrated approach is governed by Dilmah's Environmental Management Policy and ESG Policy, which jointly define the parameters of its Sustainability Strategy. Structured around seven strategic pillars and 29 focus areas, this strategy is underpinned by Dilmah's founding philosophy that "Business is a Matter of Human Service."
