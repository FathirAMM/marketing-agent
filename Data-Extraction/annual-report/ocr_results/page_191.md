Significant judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 258, 335, 377]]<|/det|>
The Group determines the lease term as the non- cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 394, 338, 604]]<|/det|>
The Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional terms of one year. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew.

### 2.13 Inventories  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 636, 335, 710]]<|/det|>
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs are those expenses incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition and are determined as follows:  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 718, 335, 881]]<|/det|>
Raw Material are valued on a first in first out (FIFO) basis Finished Goods are valued at weighted average costs, which includes all direct expenditure and appropriate share of production overhead based on normal operating capacity Packing materials are valued at weighted average costs  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 138, 626, 205]]<|/det|>
Consumables and spares are valued at weighted average costs Goods- in- transits are valued at actual costs  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 220, 618, 280]]<|/det|>
Provision for inventory obsolescence is estimated on a systematic basis and deducted from the gross carrying value of the inventory.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 295, 624, 369]]<|/det|>
Net realisable value is based on the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred on completion and disposal.

### 2.14 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 416, 627, 688]]<|/det|>
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash generating unit's fair value less costs to sell or its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or Group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
