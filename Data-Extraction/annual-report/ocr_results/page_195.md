### 2.22 Segment Reporting  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 156, 338, 336]]<|/det|>
A business segment is distinguishable component of an enterprise that is engaged in providing an individual product or service or a Group of related products or services that is subject to risk and returns that are different from those of other business segments. The accounting policies adopted for segment reporting are the same accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 351, 339, 545]]<|/det|>
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by the Senior Management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 562, 341, 636]]<|/det|>
Segment results that are reported to the Chairman include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

### 2.23 Earnings Per Share  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 668, 337, 862]]<|/det|>
The Group presents basic and diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted- average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

### 2.24 Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 186, 620, 365]]<|/det|>
The preparation of the Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of income, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the reporting date. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 380, 625, 500]]<|/det|>
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future.

## Useful life-time of the Property, Plant, and equipment  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 547, 615, 652]]<|/det|>
The Group reviews the useful lives and methods of depreciation of assets at each reporting date. Judgement of the management is exercised in the estimation of these values, rates, methods and hence they are subject to uncertainty.

## Impairment of Fair Value of Other Comprehensive Income Investments  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 699, 626, 863]]<|/det|>
The Group treats equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income/available for sale as impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below its cost or where other objective evidence of impairment exists. The determination of what is "significant" or "prolonged" requires considerable judgment. The Group treats "significant" generally as \(20\%\) or more  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 140, 916, 227]]<|/det|>
and 'prolonged' greater than six (6) months. In addition, the Group evaluates other factors, including normal volatility in share price for quoted equities and the future cash flows and the discount factors for unquoted equities.

## Impairment of Trade Receivables  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 261, 913, 441]]<|/det|>
The Group assess on a forward- looking basis the expected credit loss associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for trade receivables the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by SLFRS 9 which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognise from initial recognition of the receivables.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 456, 909, 620]]<|/det|>
At the reporting date, gross trade receivables of the Group were Rs. 7,463 million (2024 - Rs. 6,750 million) with allowance for impairment of trade receivables amounting to Rs.458 million (2024 - Rs. 648 million) and gross trade receivables of the Company were Rs. 7,378 million (2024 - Rs. 6,696 million) with allowance for impairment of trade receivables amounting to Rs. 450 million (2024 - Rs.647 million).

## Employee Defined Benefit Plan - Gratuity  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 667, 898, 877]]<|/det|>
The employee benefit liability of the Group is based on the actuarial valuation carried out by Independent actuarial specialists. The actuarial valuations involve making assumptions about discount rates and future salary increases. The complexity of the valuation, the underlying assumptions and its long- term nature, the defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. Management reviews all assumptions at each reporting date and revised assumptions where appropriate.
