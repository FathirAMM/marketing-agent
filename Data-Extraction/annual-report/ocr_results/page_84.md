## GRI 2-28 INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND INDUSTRY EXPERTISE  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 191, 341, 416]]<|/det|>
Dilmah has cultivated a robust foundation of institutional knowledge and industry expertise, stemming from the deep understanding and vision of the Company's founder, Merrill J. Fernando. His pioneering approach to tea has been passed down to the current generation of leadership through hands- on experience and a commitment to staying true to Dilmah's core values. While this legacy forms the basis of operational and strategic decisions, it continues to be refined and strengthened through continuous learning and exposure to evolving industry dynamics.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 447, 341, 794]]<|/det|>
As a thought leader, Dilmah also embraces external talent to expand its influence beyond internal expertise and nurture a sustainable and dynamic ecosystem for culinary excellence. This is the world's first consumer and hospitality tea school, which unlike existing tea training facilities, seeks to educate professionals in the hospitality and culinary industries - those on the 'front lines' of customer service internationally with an understanding of the attributes of tea. The partnership is designed to inspire passion in tea through knowledge of the artisanal aspects of tea. This programme offers a World Association of Chef's Societies (WACS) recognised culinary education certification. WACS is a World Chef's body consisting of 10 million chefs and the Dilmah School of Tea is the first and only WACS certified Tea School.

The brand's thought leadership is further demonstrated through publications like Wisdom in the Leaf and Tea and Your Health, which highlight the science, culture, and wellness aspects of tea, reinforcing Dilmah's commitment to education and innovation. These elements collectively position Dilmah not just as a tea exporter, but as a global authority in premium, value- added tea.

Furthermore, Dilmah's active memberships and affiliations with various industry- related organisations enhance its knowledge base and industry visibility. These connections enable the Company to stay at the forefront of sectoral trends, regulatory developments, and innovation, further enriching its institutional capabilities while reinforcing its leadership in the global tea industry.
