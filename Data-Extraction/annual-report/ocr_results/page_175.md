# STATEMENT BY THE SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 140, 343, 278]]<|/det|>
On 01st January 2025, I was appointed by the Board of Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company Plc as the Senior Independent Director (SID) of the Company, since Mr. Rajan Asirwathan who served as the SID was reclassified as Non- Independent in accordance with the criteria for independence stipulated in the Governance Rules of the Listing Rules of the Colombo Stock Exchange.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 292, 343, 652]]<|/det|>
It is a requirement for listed companies to appoint an Independent Director as the SID if the Chairperson is an Executive Director, and/or if the position of the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer is held by the same person and/or if the Chairperson and the CEO are close family members. These rules are provided in Section 9.6.3 of the Listing Rules and the Code of Best Practice on Corporate Governance 2023 issued by the CA Sri Lanka. At Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company PLC, Mr. Dilhan Fernando as an executive Director holds the combined roles of Chairman and CEO. The Board has determined that this is the best and most appropriate arrangement for the Company per the vision the founder Chairman Late Merrill J. Fernando had for the Dilmah brand and in taking forward his legacy. Mr. Dilhan Fernando as the younger son of Late Merrill Fernando is expected to hold the same vision, heritage and core values the Company has painstakingly cultivated over the years.

## ROLE OF THE SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 696, 334, 847]]<|/det|>
The Senior Independent Director (SID) provides guidance to the Chairman on matters of governance of the Company. The role of the SID also provides emphasis to transparency on matters relating to governance and calls for a review of the effectiveness of the Board. The SID makes himself available to any Director or any employee to have confidential discussions on the affairs of the Company should the need arise.

## ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEAR  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 155, 630, 389]]<|/det|>
During the year I presided over meetings called for evaluation of Board Performance and exercised my voting rights where necessary. A meeting was held as a virtual meeting with the Non- Executive Directors without the presence of the Executive Directors. At this meeting the performance of the Chairman and the Executive Directors were appraised. The Non- Executive Directors expressed their satisfaction on governance matters and the creditable performance of the Chairman who created a conducive environment for unfettered opinions and suggestions. The decisions were unanimous, and I did not need to exercise my voting rights.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 404, 627, 596]]<|/det|>
A separate meeting was held only with the Independent Directors discussions where we candidly discussed matters relating to the Company and the operation of the Board. The Independent Directors applauded the creditable performance of the Company which was well governed and where annual targets were met. They also mentioned areas which needed improvement. As it is my responsibility, the outcome of these meetings together with recommendations were duly informed by me to the Chairman and the Board.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 611, 629, 764]]<|/det|>
The Company follows a policy of strict compliance with mandatory requirements while embracing voluntary adherence. I am available for all key stakeholders to raise any concerns which they have. I believe such unbiased and independent engagements have made a positive impact on value creation. As such I believe that I have fulfilled the obligations entrusted to the SID in accordance with the Corporate Governance guidelines.
