<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 138, 626, 349]]<|/det|>
appointed a Senior Independent Director (SID) in line with good governance practices. The SID plays a vital role in upholding the independence and objectivity of the Board by providing an alternative channel of communication for shareholders and acting as a sounding board for the Chairman. The SID also facilitates the resolution of any concerns that may arise in situations where the Chairman may have a conflict of interest and ensures that the views of Independent Directors are effectively represented.
