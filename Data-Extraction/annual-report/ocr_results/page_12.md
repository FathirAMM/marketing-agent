## DATA COLLECTION AND REPORT PREPARATION  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 170, 343, 365]]<|/det|>
The information presented in this Integrated Annual Report has been generated from a wide array of credible sources. Strategic insights were gathered through in- depth interviews with key members of Dilmah's leadership, including the Executive Chairman/ CEO and members of the Corporate Management Team. These internal perspectives offer a comprehensive understanding of the Company's strategic direction, operational priorities, and value creation approach.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 380, 343, 532]]<|/det|>
The entire reporting process was managed under the oversight of a dedicated internal reporting team, working in close collaboration with external experts to ensure accuracy, depth, and reliability of information and upholding the highest standards of rigour, transparency, and integrity in the preparation of Dilmah's Integrated Annual Report.

## MATERIALITY  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[93, 594, 328, 727]]<|/det|>
The principle of Materiality serves as a key aspect guiding the selection and prioritisation of content of the Integrated Annual Report. This approach aims to ensure disclosures provide a focused and transparent narrative that captures what matters most to both the business and its stakeholders.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[93, 744, 325, 878]]<|/det|>
By highlighting the most significant issues that influence the Company's ability to create value over the short, medium, and long term, the materiality- driven reporting process enhances the clarity and relevance of disclosures, in turn reinforcing stakeholder trust, and confidence in Dilmah's long- term sustainability.
