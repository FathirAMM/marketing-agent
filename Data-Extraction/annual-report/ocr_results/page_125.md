## (DISTRIBUTION OF DRY RATIONS) 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 190, 627, 245]]<|/det|>
The first-ever "Kindness Day" - in memory of Merrill J. Fernando - was held on his birthday, as a tribute to his lifelong commitment to compassion and service. 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 258, 625, 405]]<|/det|>
To honour his legacy, the day was marked by meaningful acts of kindness, including the distribution of dry rations to underserved communities. This initiative reflected his enduring belief in using business as a force for good—uplifting people, supporting communities, and protecting nature. It served as a heartfelt continuation of the values he lived by and instilled in all of us.
