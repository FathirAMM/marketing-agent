Going ConcernIn determining the basis of preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025, based on available information, the management has assessed the existing and anticipated effects current economic conditions on the Group and the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis. In March 2025, the management evaluated the resilience of its businesses considering a wide range of factors under multiple stress tested scenarios, relating to expected revenue streams, cost management, profitability, the ability to defer non- essential capital expenditure, debt repayment schedules, if any, cash reserves and potential sources of financing facilities, if required, and the ability to continue providing goods to ensure businesses continue as least impacted as possible.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 488, 341, 653]]<|/det|>
Having presented the outlook to the Board, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the Financial Statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis.

### 3.1 SLFRS 17 Insurance Contracts  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 231, 625, 637]]<|/det|>
SLFRS 17 is a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Once effective, SLFRS 17 will replace SLFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that was issued in 2005. SLFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non- life, direct insurance and re- insurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope exceptions will apply. The overall objective of SLFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers. In contrast to the requirements in SLFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local accounting policies, SLFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting aspects. The core of SLFRS 17 is the general model, supplemented by:  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 646, 625, 743]]<|/det|>
A specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach) A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for shortduration contracts  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 758, 628, 894]]<|/det|>
SLFRS 17 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026, with comparative figures required. Early application is permitted, provided the entity also applies SLFRS 9 and SLFRS 15 on or before the date it first applies SLFRS 17. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial statement

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 170, 900, 244]]<|/det|>
The amendments specify how an entity should assess whether a currency is exchangeable and how it should determine a spot exchange rate when exchangeability is lacking.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 260, 911, 380]]<|/det|>
The amendments also require disclosure of information that enables users of its financial statements to understand how the currency not being exchangeable into the other currency affects, or is expected to affect, the entity's financial performance, financial position and cash flows.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 396, 911, 530]]<|/det|>
