Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company PLC (Dilmah) is among the most iconic global tea brands, celebrated for its unwavering commitment to quality, authenticity, and integrity in tea production. Established in 1985 by Merrill J. Fernando Dilmah pioneered the world's first Single Origin tea brand which ensured every leaf was not only grown but also handpicked, processed, and packed at origin. This unique approach, now a hallmark of the Dilmah brand, allows for superior quality control, ethical sourcing, and greater value retention within Sri Lanka, benefiting both the national economy and its tea- growing communities.
