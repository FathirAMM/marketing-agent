<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 261, 620, 379]]<|/det|>

# Impairment-Recognition of expected credit losses

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 802, 610, 858]]<|/det|>
The Group recognise a loss allowance for expected credit losses on a Trade Receivables to which the impairment requirements apply.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 141, 917, 242]]<|/det|>
At each reporting date, the Group measure the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 261, 902, 407]]<|/det|>
The objective of the impairment requirements is to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for all financial instruments for which there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition — whether assessed on an individual or collective basis — considering all reasonable and supportable information, including that which is forward-looking.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 554, 912, 625]]<|/det|>
(i) do not contain a significant financing component (or when the entity applies the practical expedient for contracts that are one year or less) in accordance with SLFRS 15; or

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 645, 914, 807]]<|/det|>
(ii) contain a significant financing component in accordance with SLFRS 15, if the entity chooses as its accounting policy to measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. That accounting policy shall be applied to all such trade receivables or contract assets but may be applied separately to trade receivables and contract assets.
