## REVENUE  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 155, 337, 426]]<|/det|>
REVENUEDilmah Ceylon Tea Company PLC delivered a strong performance in FY 2024/25, with revenue growing by \(14\%\) year- on- year, from LKR 18.5 billion to LKR 21.2 billion. Growth was underpinned by a \(21\%\) increase in sales volumes, testifying to the fact that Dilmah's focus on product differentiation, authenticity, and quality, continue to resonate with global consumers. Key growth markets included Europe, Asia, and Oceania, supported by strategic brand- building campaigns to boost visibility and sales in these regions. Likewise continued expansion of the premium product category across all regions also contributed notably to volume growth for the current year.

## COST OF SALES  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 456, 341, 636]]<|/det|>
Cost of sales rose by \(20\%\) year on year, primarily due to a significant escalation in tea prices. Prices for Dilmah tea standards at the Colombo Tea auction increased by \(15\%\) on average with prices in certain elevations reaching historic highs during 2024. Consequently, the Company's cost structure came under strain despite its efforts to mitigate volatility through long- term supplier partnerships and forward sourcing strategies.

## GROSS PROFIT  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 669, 343, 848], [367, 140, 603, 168]]<|/det|>
GROSS PROFITWith the sharp increase in cost of sales offsetting strong gains attributed to volume- led revenue growth, Dilmah registered only a modest \(6\%\) improvement in gross profit for FY 2024/25. While the strong performance of premium and other top product ranges, sales and expansion into key international markets offered some degree of resilience, the impact of elevated input costs was also evident in the contraction of the gross profit margin, which declined from \(39\%\) in FY 2023/24 to \(36\%\) in the current year.

## OPERATING PROFIT & PROFIT BEFORE TAX (PBT)  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 214, 630, 272]]<|/det|>
Operating profit for FY 2024/25 increased by \(116\%\) from the combination of exchange gain and prudent management of administration and operational costs.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 289, 627, 454]]<|/det|>
Overall, Administrative expenses decreased only marginally despite the \(25\%\) increase in depreciation attributed to the LKR 1.8 billion capital investment in new tea bagging machinery, underscoring the success of internal cost containment and efficiency improvement measures. Most notably, Energy costs declined by \(25\%\) year- on- year, owing to the continued transition to solar energy and reduction in tariff.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 470, 625, 602]]<|/det|>
On the other hand, S&D expenses increased significantly as the Company ramped up market development and promotional activities in key international markets. These investments, while impacting short- term profitability, are expected to strengthen brand equity and consumer engagement in the medium term.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 140, 910, 243]]<|/det|>
Meanwhile, finance costs declined in FY 2024/25 owing to the absence of the short- term arbitration loan that had been in place the previous year. The recurring lease liabilities under right- of- use assets were the only material finance cost component for the current year.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 259, 915, 349]]<|/det|>
Finance income declined sharply by LKR 449 million, as USD deposits were uplifted to fund capital investments, while lower market interest rates contributed to reduced income on both foreign currency and LKR denominated deposits.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 365, 902, 499]]<|/det|>
Additionally, in contrast to the previous year's exchange loss, Dilmah reported a foreign exchange gain of LKR 452 million in the current year owing to the favourable exchange rate movements in 2024, particularly the LKR against USD and AUD, which benefited the Company's foreign currency- denominated receivables and deposits.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 515, 915, 589]]<|/det|>
Collectively, these factors enable Dilmah to table PBT of LKR 1.7 billion for FY 2024/25, denoting a \(21\%\) year- on- year increase from the LKR 1.4 billion reported in the previous financial year.

## PROFIT AFTER TAX (PAT)  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 620, 888, 710]]<|/det|>
Profit After Tax (PAT) declined by \(4.7\%\) due to provision of income tax for previous years tax assessments and deferred tax liability arised from the investment in new machinery and unrealised exchange gain.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 726, 910, 844]]<|/det|>
However, the Company enjoyed a significant tax benefit in the reporting year from the investment in new tea bagging machinery designed to support the shift to environmentally friendly packaging solutions in line with evolving packaging regulations and sustainability standards across key international
