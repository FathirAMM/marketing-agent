## BRAND LEADERSHIP AND GLOBAL MARKET INFLUENCE  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[81, 156, 629, 275]]<|/det|>
Dilmah's position as a global leader in tea stems from the pioneering vision of its founder, Merrill J. Fernando, whose legacy of unblended tea has transformed the global tea industry. At a time when the global market trended towards blending for commercial gain, thereby diluting origin identity and compromising quality, Dilmah chose to remain unblended, preserving the nuanced characteristics derived from soil, climate, and artisanal processing. In 1988 Dilmah became the first local brand to offer tea that was grown, picked, perfected, and packed at source in Sri Lanka, a tradition that continues to date and remains at the heart of the Dilmah brand identity.

Moreover, Dilmah's vertically integrated model enables the creation of unique offerings such as single estate teas, seasonal teas, and ready- to- drink (RTD) iced teas - products that reflect the purity and integrity of garden- fresh Ceylon tea.

Today, Dilmah is globally recognised not only as a premium tea brand but as a symbol of integrity, quality, and purpose. Dilmah's core values of Taste, Goodness, and Purpose, are encapsulated in the Company's commitment to authentic, origin- grown tea and its ethical approach to business continues to influence global markets, offering a compelling alternative to commoditised tea brands and solidifying Dilmah's place as a trailblazer in the international tea industry.

Over the years, Dilmah has continued to challenge convention and shape global perceptions of tea, elevating it from a commodity to an artisanal experience. Initiatives such as the Dilmah School of Tea, Seasonal Flush collections, and the Tea Gastronomy programme have served to deepen consumer appreciation for the complexity, culture, and versatility of tea. These efforts not only reflect Dilmah's commitment to excellence but also reaffirm the brand's role as a steward of tea heritage and a catalyst for a more equitable, sustainable future in tea.

Dilmah's impact extends beyond the global tea industry to Sri Lanka's national identity and economy. By championing value addition at origin and packing at source, Dilmah has effectively placed Sri Lanka on the world map as a producer of some of the finest teas available, earning the Country global recognition and respect. Today, Dilmah stands as the largest foreign exchange earner for value- added teas in Sri Lanka, contributing significantly to the nation's export economy.
