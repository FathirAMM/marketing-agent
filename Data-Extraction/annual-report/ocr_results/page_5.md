We believe in the transformative power of tea. Taste is important, as is the natural Goodness in every sip of our Teas, although equally the soils, livelihoods, biodiversity and future of our tea industry.

Dilmah was born of a Teamaker's devotion to tea and kindness, and our uniqueness today are the values that anchor our brand. Our Founder set out to make the world a better tea, and with faith, passion and commitment, his Dilmah prevailed against corrosive commoditisation in the industry.

That same belief, and the Quality, Integrity and Purpose we honour without compromise are our Strength, Resilience and Future.
