## GRI 2-10 APPOINTMENT/RE-ELECTION/RESIGNATION/RETIREMENT OF DIRECTORS  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 192, 342, 491]]<|/det|>
The appointment of Directors to the Dilmah Board follows a structured and transparent process overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee (NGC). The Committee is responsible for evaluating prospective candidates based on their professional credentials, industry expertise, and leadership capabilities that can add significant value to the Company's strategic direction. The Committee conducts rigorous assessment of all potential candidates, including their skills and capabilities as well as their reputation for integrity and ethics. As part of this evaluation, careful consideration is also given to the number and nature of external directorships held by each prospective Director to ensure they can devote adequate time and focus to their responsibilities.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 506, 340, 672]]<|/det|>
In line with Dilmah's Articles of Association and established governance practices, One Director retires by rotation at each Annual General Meeting (AGM), and may offer themselves for re- election by the shareholders. The eligibility of retiring Directors is reviewed by the Nominations Committee, considering their performance, active engagement in Board proceedings, and their strategic contribution to the Company.

Directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy during the year are also required to seek shareholder approval at the subsequent AGM in order to continue in office.

## CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 410, 614, 590]]<|/det|>
All members of the Dilmah Board are held to the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct and as part of their fiduciary responsibility, are expected to act in the best interests of shareholders and stakeholders at all times. Each Director is expected to demonstrate unwavering commitment to ethical leadership by avoiding any circumstances be it real, perceived, or potential that may give rise to a conflict of interest.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 606, 618, 848]]<|/det|>
To this end, Directors are obligated to exercise sound, independent judgment and proactively disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest without delay. The responsibility for overseeing conflict- of- interest disclosures lies with the Related Party Transactions Review Committee (RPTRC), which plays a critical role in maintaining objectivity and governance integrity. The Committee rigorously evaluates each disclosure, taking into account the nature, significance, and implications of the conflict, and provides clear recommendations for mitigation or recusal as necessary.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[652, 374, 886, 525]]<|/det|>
In line with global best practices and the principles of good governance, any Director with a personal interest in a matter under discussion is required to recuse themselves from related deliberations and decisions. This disciplined approach reinforces stakeholder trust and preserves the independence, impartiality, and effectiveness of the Board.
