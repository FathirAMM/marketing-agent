<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 486, 615, 499]]<|/det|>

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 509, 625, 688]]<|/det|>

In relation to sales with local customers, this point is generally the delivery of goods, exports also take in to account the term related to each shipment of goods. The Group considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated.
