## BRAND ECOSYSTEM APPROACH  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 155, 892, 216]]<|/det|>
Dilmah's Brand Ecosystem Approach represents a holistic and purpose- driven model that integrates commercial success with environmental stewardship and social responsibility. Rather than treating business functions in isolation, this approach recognises the interdependence of all stakeholders—employees, consumers, growers, suppliers, and the wider community—within a shared value system.
