Recruitment for the executive cadre is primarily carried out through online job postings, professional recruitment agencies, and internal referrals. Similar methods are used for hiring clerical and allied categories supplemented by more traditional approaches such as newspaper advertisements. Dilmah also strongly encourages internal mobility by inviting existing employees to apply for vacant positions, fostering career growth and long-term retention.

An important source of new talent for Dilmah is the ongoing Internship Programme (DIP), which targets students from universities and technical colleges across Sri Lanka. This paid internship initiative provides participants with hands-on industrial training designed to complement academic knowledge. The programme has proven to be an effective pipeline for attracting skilled, job-ready candidates with minimal lead time, thereby strengthening the Company's external talent pool.

Dilmah further strengthened its partnerships with leading educational institutions by signing Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) with the University of Kelaniya and the University of Jaffna,and by engaging in ongoing discussions with Korea Tech to expand its internship programme, thereby creating a platform for the early identification of high-potential talent and facilitating their seamless transition into Dilmah's workforce.

Dilmah values the commitment and loyalty of its employees, which is reinforced by a strong benefits package featuring competitive salaries and an engaging work environment. This has led to impressive employee retention,with 88.1% remaining with the company and a turnover rate of just 11.9% of the employees who are in the permanent cadre over one year during the reporting period. As much as 95.3% of senior management cadre is recruited locally from Sri Lanka.
