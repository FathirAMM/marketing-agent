Mr. Malik J. Fernando was appointed to the Board of Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company PLC (formerly Ceylon Tea Services PLC) in September 1991 as an Executive Director. He is the Founder of Respondent Ceylon, home to a collection of luxury Sri Lankan boutique resorts, also known as the hospitality arm of Dilmah Tea. He is additionally the second- generation owner, together with his brother Dilhan, of MJF Holdings & Dilmah Tea, founded by his father, Merrill J. Fernando in 1985. Having grown up and studied overseas, Mr. Fernando decided to return home to pursue a career with Dilmah upon his graduation from Babson College, Boston, in 1989. Armed with his passion for the evergreen, lush nature in Sri Lanka, he strongly believed in the potential for Sri Lanka to become a luxury tourist holiday destination. Coupled with his desire to tell stories through tea, his first venture was the boutique resort, Ceylon Tea Trails, the world's first tea bungalow resort built on working tea estates, which also echoed his devotion to tea. Reflecting his goal to make Sri Lanka a luxury destination, Ceylon Tea Trails is also the first Relais & Chateaux resort in Sri Lanka, and the first on the coveted Conde Nast Gold List. In a bid to complete what he dubbed the "best of Sri Lanka circuit", comprising the three most distinctive offerings in the country - tea, sea, and safari, he went on to spearhead Cape Weligama which features breathtaking ocean views and Wild Coast Tented Lodge which gives a taste of the jungle. Guided by the Dilmah philosophy that business must also be a matter of human service, he has led various positive impact initiatives within
