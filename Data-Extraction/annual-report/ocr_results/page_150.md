## DILMAH'S APPROACH TO GOOD GOVERNANCE

Integrity serves as the foundation of all business practices and underscores the commitment to conducting business affairs with honesty, fairness, and a deep respect for ethical principles. This commitment extends across the value chain, from ethical sourcing and responsible marketing to stakeholder engagement, ensuring that trust and credibility are maintained at all times.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 502, 341, 620]]<|/det|>
Accountability is reinforced through well- defined governance structures, clear lines of responsibility, and robust internal controls ensure that strategic and operational decisions are made in alignment with the Company's long- term objectives, while holding decision- makers responsible for outcomes.
