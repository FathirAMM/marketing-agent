<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 183, 316, 378]]<|/det|>
It is my privilege to present the Annual Report of Dilmah Ceylon Tea Company PLC (DCTC) and its subsidiary, MJF Beverages Pvt Ltd, for the financial year ended 31st March 2025.

## RESILIENCE ROOTED IN PURPOSE  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 416, 340, 581]]<|/det|>
Markets globally became vastly more challenging than we could ever have imagined; rising inflation, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, disruptions to global trade routes, and continued economic fragility in key markets created an uncertain environment. Typically these manifest in higher costs, logistics and supply chain delays which combined with greater price pressure to create a toxic environment for quality.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 596, 341, 793]]<|/det|>
As the philosophy and purpose of Dilmah demand, these challenges were met with fresh affirmation of our founding values. In honouring our Founder's emphasis on quality, expanding our commitment to sustainability for broader industry benefit, and increasing our emphasis on kindness to people, we strengthened our resilience. In the knowledge that a team that is genuinely led by a greater purpose will always be stronger, we resisted pressure to compromise, given the wider social and economic purpose of Dilmah.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 808, 335, 882]]<|/det|>
At the heart of Dilmah's resilience lies the knowledge that business must serve humanity. This principle - defined by my father, Merrill J. Fernando - underpins every decision we make, from the  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 140, 629, 227]]<|/det|>
manner in which we produce and market our tea to our interaction with communities and natural ecosystems. Financial Year 2024/25 has been a year in which our purpose was tested, but also strengthened.

## STABLE GROWTH AMID GLOBAL VOLATILITY  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 273, 629, 454]]<|/det|>
Against this challenging backdrop, DCTC delivered stable financial performance, demonstrating both resilience and disciplined execution. The Group reported consolidated revenue of LKR 21.16 billion, a \(14\%\) increase from the previous year. This topline growth was supported by a balanced mix of pricing discipline, proactive product development and increased demand for premium products, complemented by growth in several key territories.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 469, 626, 590]]<|/det|>
Profit Before Tax for the period stood at LKR 1.69 billion, a significant recovery compared to the prior year's fore- influenced volatility. Strict cost controls, margin optimisation, supply chain efficiencies, and prudent currency management helped to protect and grow the profitability.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 606, 625, 650]]<|/det|>
Net assets grew steadily, reinforcing the Group's long- term financial strength, with total assets exceeding LKR 28 billion.

## EXPANDING INNOVATION & MARKET RELEVANCE  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 697, 626, 892]]<|/det|>
Our focus on product innovation continued to emphasise the uniqueness of the Dilmah brand. During the year in review, 35 new products were launched, connecting Dilmah with a new generation of consumers, with an appreciation of natural wellness, health and natural beverages and experiential dining. Innovations included enhanced antioxidant and immunity- boosting teas, as well as specialty artisanal teas aligned with the premiumisation trend in the tea category.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 140, 912, 289]]<|/det|>
Investments and research into compostable and sustainable packaging solutions advanced, aimed at minimising our impact on the environment while maintaining the taste and goodness in our teas and herbs. These innovations are an essential part of our broader environmental stewardship agenda, which remains central to our long- term competitiveness.

## BRAND EXCELLENCE AND GLOBAL RECOGNITION  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[653, 334, 914, 469]]<|/det|>
During the year, Dilmah was recognised internationally for its brand leadership and integrity. We were honoured to retain our position as New Zealand's Most Trusted Tea Brand for the ninth consecutive year. In Sri Lanka, Dilmah was recognised at the Presidential Export Awards, reaffirming our contribution to the national export economy.

Our growing success in digital marketing, e- commerce expansion, and strengthened customer engagement platforms allowed us to reach new demographics, particularly younger consumers who increasingly demand both product authenticity and responsible business practices.
