## CHANNEL PARTNER ON-BOARDING  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 154, 915, 215]]<|/det|>
Dilmah's distributor onboarding process begins with identifying or receiving interest from potential partners, followed by a thorough assessment of their experience, market knowledge, infrastructure, and financial capability. If they meet the required criteria, they must present a detailed market strategy, after which both parties align on mutual expectations. A trial order is then conducted to evaluate performance before formalising the partnership through a distribution agreement.

## PERFORMANCE MONITORING

Once a distributor is onboarded, clear sales targets and marketing plans are established to guide performance expectations. To support partners in achieving these goals, comprehensive product training, marketing materials, and continuous operational support are provided. Sales performance, inventory levels, and payment cycles are closely tracked to ensure efficiency and alignment with business objectives, while regular communication is maintained to address challenges and share updates. High- performing partners are recognised through special acknowledgements and rewards, including at Dilmah's Global Family Conference which takes place in Sri Lanka every two years.
