Risk governance at Dilmah is built around the commitment to ethical leadership and sound corporate governance. The Board of Directors, as the highest governing authority, holds ultimate responsibility for risk oversight and is tasked with ensuring the implementation of a robust and effective risk management framework. This framework is designed to uphold the core principles of accountability, transparency, responsiveness, and stakeholder inclusivity. These principles are operationalised through a well- defined Three Lines of Defence model, which clearly delineates roles and responsibilities across the organisation to ensure that risks are proactively identified, assessed, and managed while strengthening overall organisational resilience and governance integrity.

Dilmah's risk governance was further strengthened during the reporting year following the establishment of a dedicated Risk Management Department to assist the Board in discharging its oversight responsibilities. The Head of Risk plays a key role in implementing the Enterprise Risk and Opportunity Management (EROM) framework across all business units. In this context, the Head of Risk serves as a main liaison between first and second lines of defense in driving enterprise- wide risk identification and assessment processes and ensuring alignment between strategic objectives and risk management practices as well as for promoting risk awareness culture.
