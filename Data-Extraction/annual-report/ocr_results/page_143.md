WLI Asia - Oceania ConferenceDilmah was proud to partner with the Wetland Link International (WLI) Asia- Oceania Conference, hosted for the first time in Sri Lanka. On the fourth day of the conference, Dilmah welcomed over 65 participants from across Asia- Oceania to the Beddagana Wetland Park in Colombo. Guided by a team of wetland educators, conference participants—including wetland researchers—were astonished by the rich biodiversity thriving within this urban wetland. As the network's flagship event, the conference facilitates the sharing of best practices and lessons learned from wetland conservation, education, participation, and awareness (CEPA) activities, while also shaping future plans for the network.

Dusk to Dawn: Exploring the Wetland WonderThis was the first- ever night wetland excursion at Beddagana. Dilmah's "Dusk to Dawn" event, held on February 1st and 2nd in celebration of World Wetlands Day, aimed to raise awareness about wetland biodiversity and the importance of protecting these ecosystems. Hosted at the Beddagana Wetlands of the Ramsar- accredited Colombo Wetland Complex, the event offered free public access and included expert- led knowledge sessions, a wetland night walk, and interactive experiences such as mist netting, bat education, and camera trapping demonstrations. A panel discussion highlighted conservation efforts and the significance of the Ramsar status. On the second day, a guided morning walk included a fun and educational scavenger hunt for children, promoting awareness of native and endemic species.

## A training on Climate adaptation  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 291, 910, 501]]<|/det|>
A training on Climate adaptation was conducted with the technical assistance of USAID for 20 farmers. Further necessary technical advice was also provided by Natural Resources Management Centre (NRMC) in the areas of land preparation and relevant climate adaptation practices and climate- resilient cultivation practices, tailored to specific soil types, topography, and intercropping needs. Following NRMC's recommendations, farmers have now completed land preparation and planted cashew plants along with intercrops identified as suitable for their lands.
