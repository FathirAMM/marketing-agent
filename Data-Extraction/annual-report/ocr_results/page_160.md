## ESG GOVERNANCE  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 515, 340, 666]]<|/det|>
Dilmah's ESG governance framework is structured to ensure sustainability is deeply embedded across its operations, strategic decision- making, and value creation agenda. Anchored in a comprehensive ESG Policy and guided by a refreshed ESG strategy, the governance structure reflects a strong commitment to responsible business conduct and long- term stakeholder value.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 682, 343, 861]]<|/det|>
Operating under the delegated authority of the Board, the ESG Board Committee, provides strategic oversight and guidance on ESG- related matters, ensuring alignment between the Company's sustainability goals and overall business strategy. As part of its duties, the ESG Board Committee also undertakes to review progress against ESG KPIs and advise the Board on high- level decisions that shape the Company's long- term sustainability roadmap.

Operational governance is led by the ESG Executive Committee. This committee is responsible for the annual review of material topics, evaluating stakeholder engagement processes, and recommending ESG- related strategies and targets to be integrated into business plans. The committee also reviews all ESG disclosures and reports, while escalating critical issues and submitting meeting minutes to the Board for oversight.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[366, 335, 629, 499]]<|/det|>
Implementation of ESG initiatives is driven by three core entities: the Dilmah Conservation & Sustainability Department, the Environmental Management System (EMS) Team, and the MJF Charitable Foundation. Together, these teams ensure the execution of ESG strategies and initiatives on the ground, creating a strong operational link between governance structures and measurable impact.

Accordingly, Dilmah's Integrated Annual Report includes disclosures guided by the International Integrated Reporting (<IR>) Framework, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework. In addition, the Company has begun incorporating the Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standards (SLFRS) S1 and S2 on sustainability- related financial disclosures, demonstrating its readiness to align with emerging global best practices in order to provide stakeholders with clear, consistent, and decision- useful sustainability information.
