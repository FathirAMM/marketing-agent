## Operational Waste Reduction & Productivity Enhancement  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[104, 187, 335, 272]]<|/det|>
Using Root Cause Analysis, Lean Six Sigma, and cross- functional collaboration, this initiative streamlined manufacturing by eliminating non- value- adding activities and enhancing machine performance, in turn directly supporting quality enhancement and continuous process improvement, promoting operational excellence and productivity.

## Glue Usage Optimisation in Carton Packaging  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[450, 198, 739, 251]]<|/det|>
This project was aimed at improving the process for boxboard gluing by recalibrating operating parameters, lowering glue viscosity temperatures, and enhancing bond strength. The result was reduced energy use, material savings, and improved product quality.

## KEY MILESTONE IN PACKAGING INNOVATION - HOME COMPOSTABLE POT TEA BAGS  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 590, 498, 650]]<|/det|>
Each year, Dilmah invests substantially in research and innovation to advance its goal of achieving \(100\%\) biodegradable packaging, focusing on the development of tea bags and packaging materials that are fully compostable in both home and industrial settings.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 664, 501, 891]]<|/det|>
Following years of research by the Company's Quality Assurance team, Dilmah achieved a key milestone in the current year by obtaining globally recognised home and industrial compostability certifications from both the Australasian Bioplastics Association (ABA) and DIN CERTCO for its Pot Tea Bag/Tag- Free Tea Bag range. The certification which was awarded after rigorous internal testing, followed by external verification by the internationally respected laboratory DIN CERTCO, stands as a major achievement in Dilmah packaging innovation journey and places Dilmah as one of the first in the value- added tea sector to secure a home compostability certification for a tag- free tea bag. As a result, Dilmah is now eligible to use five globally recognised compostability logos on its pot tea bag packaging, showcasing its leadership in sustainable packaging solutions and its unwavering commitment to reducing environmental impact.
