## 2.8 Foreign Currency Translation

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 247, 626, 424]]<|/det|>
The Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lanka Rupees, which is the Group's functional and presentation currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to profit or loss.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 441, 621, 574]]<|/det|>
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.

## 2.9 Property, Plant and Equipment

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 608, 625, 892]]<|/det|>
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment.Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases future economic benefits of the related item of property, plant and equipment and the cost can be reliably measured. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour,any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 141, 908, 182]]<|/det|>
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets except land, as follows:

<|ref|>table<|/ref|><|det|>[[652, 191, 914, 327]]<|/det|>

<table><tr><td>Buildings on Leasehold Land</td><td>Over the lease period</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and Machinery</td><td>Over 10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Factory Equipment</td><td>Over 5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and Fittings</td><td>Over 7 years</td></tr><tr><td>Office and Stores</td><td>Over 5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Equipment</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Computer Hardware</td><td>Over 3 years</td></tr><tr><td>Motor Vehicles</td><td>Over 5 years</td></tr></table>

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 342, 911, 505]]<|/det|>
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount being the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 523, 917, 701]]<|/det|>
The asset's residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate,at end of each reporting period. An estimation change in the useful life of fixed asset during the period has occurred and the underlying assumptions considered are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 719, 914, 897]]<|/det|>
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Profit or Loss when the asset is derecognised.
