# Current Income Tax

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 471, 344, 573]]<|/det|>
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 592, 338, 677]]<|/det|>
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 697, 334, 737]]<|/det|>

# Deferred Taxation

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 771, 342, 873]]<|/det|>
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[368, 140, 610, 211]]<|/det|>
·Where the deferred tax liability arises from an asset or liability in a transaction that affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 231, 623, 364]]<|/det|>
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[368, 374, 621, 475]]<|/det|>
·Where the deferred tax assets relating to deductible temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 495, 625, 672]]<|/det|>
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow the deferred tax assets to be utilised.Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 691, 620, 792]]<|/det|>
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the assets are realised or the liabilities are settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[367, 811, 626, 882]]<|/det|>
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the Statement of Profit or Loss is recognised outside the Statement of Profit or Loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[654, 140, 904, 181]]<|/det|>
