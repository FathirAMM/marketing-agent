## GRI 417-1, 417-2 PRODUCT LABELLING 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 161, 629, 265]]<|/det|>
Dilmah maintains a rigorous and transparent approach to product labelling, ensuring full compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements governing food safety, consumer information, environmental responsibility, and ethical trade practices. The Company adheres strictly to region-specific regulatory frameworks, including European Union food safety and labelling regulations for EU markets, the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) Code for Australasian countries, and JETRO (Japan External Trade Organisation) standards for Japan. 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 281, 625, 355]]<|/det|>
For all other international markets, Dilmah aligns with Codex Alimentarius guidelines, jointly developed by the FAO and WHO, ensuring consistency with globally accepted food labelling practices. In Sri Lanka, the Food Labelling Act, the regulatory framework of the Sri Lanka Tea Board, and other national statutes governing product declarations are strictly complied with. 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 371, 608, 490]]<|/det|>
These regulations cover a wide range of labelling elements, including but not limited to ingredient disclosures, allergen information, nutritional panels, shelf life, brewing instructions, and storage guidance. Environmental claims such as those pertaining to recyclability, biodegradability, or sustainable sourcing, are made only when substantiated by credible data and third-party verification, upholding consumer trust and preventing greenwashing. Furthermore, robust internal review protocols and legal compliance checks are in place to ensure that every label meets the exacting standards of accuracy, transparency, and integrity.
