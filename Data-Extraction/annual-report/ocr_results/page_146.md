The traditional two-month Pada Yathra pilgrimage from Jaffna to Kataragama generates significant waste, including clothes, plastics, and aluminum,which harms forests, wildlife, and waterways. In 2022 and 2023, large amounts of waste were collected along the route. To reduce pollution,Dilmah and other private organisations donated eco-friendly bags to pilgrims to minimise plastic and polythene waste during the pilgrimage.
