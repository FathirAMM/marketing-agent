All community initiatives at Dilmah are driven by the MJF Charitable Foundation, which embodies the vision of Dilmah's founder, Mr. Merrill J. Fernando - - that business is a matter of human service. Guided by this philosophy, the Foundation is dedicated to sharing the benefits of the company's success with disadvantaged and underserved communities across Sri Lanka. To ensure the sustainability and impact of its work, the Foundation is funded through a minimum allocation of \(15\%\) of Dilmah's annual pre- tax profits.

The MJF Foundation operates independently and is overseen by a Board of Trustees composed of members of Dilmah's top management, including two Directors of the company's Board. This structure ensures that the Foundation's activities are strategically aligned with the Group's vision. The Board of Directors provides oversight on the Foundation's strategic direction, while all significant future plans are referred back to the Board for approval ensuring robust governance and high- level accountability.
