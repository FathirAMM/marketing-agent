At Dilmah, onboarding starts well before a new employee enters the workplace. Each new team member receives a personalised welcome email, introducing them to the Company's culture and values. Simultaneously, customised welcome messages are shared with colleagues to build early rapport and familiarity. To further strengthen this sense of inclusion, all new hires are featured on the Digital Notice Board, making their arrival visible across the organisation and encouraging cross-functional connection from the outset.
