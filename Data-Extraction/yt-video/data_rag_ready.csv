Blessed Christmas Wishes from the Dilmah Family 2025,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnuSE24ECuM," Hello friends, as we celebrate Christmas, things that are happening in the world around us demand reflection on what truly matters. Values, purpose and how we can positively impact people and nature. Our grandfather wanted to make the world a better tea and by better he meant kinder, better for our health, better for nature and better tasting. He meant it sincerely, which is why Dilma has a foundation of quality and integrity with a heart of kindness. My father's dream became reality 40 years ago. It has now become the global mission for the family to touch the lives of hundreds of thousands of less fortunate people every year through our work in tea, tourism and cinnamon. Business must serve humanity. Life without purpose is meaningless. So for us this blessed season is as much about hope as it is about giving. We cannot live without hope. Yet conflict chaos and inequality around the world are pushing many towards hopelessness The coolest thing about all this is that the happiness the strength the resilience we all seek comes more easily from giving than from receiving. It's the truth, something we learnt from our grandfather's legacy of kindness. We're a family business. We believe in the transformative power of tea. Every cup presents our respect for nature and our generational commitment to quality, integrity and purpose. It's you, our customers around the world, that help us to translate that purpose into impact. True joy comes from giving. Ours is a powerful partnership in giving and receiving. Every cup, a cup of kindness. Taste and goodness with the assurance of kindness. From us all, Merry Christmas! And a happy 2026!",Success,"The family‑owned tea, tourism, and cinnamon business was founded 40 years ago, originating from the founder’s grandfather’s vision of healthier, kinder, and more sustainable products. Its stated global mission is to assist hundreds of thousands of less‑fortunate people each year through those three sectors. The company emphasizes quality, integrity, and environmental respect, attributing its impact to worldwide customers. A holiday message references the upcoming year 2026."
"Dilmah: 40 years, 40 stories - Hassan Shahin",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg8J8xUqL4M," I'm Hassan Shaheen, distribution deal in Egypt. I know Miril Fernando from 25 years ago. I remember when I started distribution deal in Egypt. Miril Fernando asked me, Mr Shaheen, I need you make improve. I need bombing in Egyptian market. Okay, Mr. Mirik, what can I do? How can I help you? I need you achieve in the first year one million dollars. This is in 2010. Okay Mr. Meryl but I think this is big number. No Mr. Shaheen you can follow, you can achieve. Yes, first year I achieved one million dollars and Meryl Fernando very very happy after I achieved this number. Every week he contacted me, Mr. Shaheen, what you make this week from Dilma? Month by month, after 12 months, we achieved this number. Of course, this is Miril Fernando, follow everything. When he needs success, he's success. This is Miril. you",Success,"Hassan Shaheen entered a distribution agreement in Egypt in 2010, working with Miril Fernando, who set a target of $1 million in revenue for the first year. Shaheen met the $1 million goal after twelve months, prompting weekly performance updates from Fernando regarding weekly sales, including a product referred to as “Dilma.” Fernando expressed satisfaction with the achieved milestone."
"Dilmah: 40 years, 40 stories - Koshy Mathew",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxSRGBcGhnE," My association with Dilma started way back in 2001. I had reached the country and we were into FMCG distribution and an ex-colleague of mine actually reached out to me and he had completed a research on tea brands internationally and he said, you know what, there is this lovely brand from Sri Lanka called Dilma which is really going to be the future of tea. And I then reached out to Mr. Fernando and he said, look, you're welcome to come and experience what Dilma is all about. And before you knew it, I was on the next flight to Colombo wherein I met Mr. Fernando and Dilma. Now it's almost 20 years later, 20, 25 years later. We're very proud to say that we've come a very long way since then. and we are the market leaders with Dilma in the premium restaurants, cafes and hotels in the UAE, something that we are very proud of. Over the years I've shared a very close relationship with Mr. Fernando. He been there for me through ups and downs in life always giving me sound advice when I needed the most And this is something that I will never forget The thing which I always remember about him is his humility. You know, despite the great person that he was, he has always remained humble. And that's something that he has actually passed on through the generations, both with Dilhan and now with Amrit coming in from the third generation. They stay grounded, they stay humble, and that for me, the true values of Dilma. And now when I see Amrit on the stage with Dilhan, it's like a flashback for me where I see the same Mr. Fernando and Dilhan all those years back. And it's like the same rerun which is happening. Dude, try it. You know, one thing that I have not come to terms with is coming to Colombo and not having to get to see Mr. Fernando. That is something that a void which will never be filled. I do miss his infectious smile and his sound advice that he used to give every time that I met him on the numerous occasions, either when I was in Colombo or when he traveled through Dubai. That void will never be filled. Thank you.",Success,"In 2001, after an ex‑colleague’s research identified Dilma as a promising Sri Lankan tea brand, the speaker traveled to Colombo and met its founder, Mr. Fernando. Over the next two decades, Dilma expanded into the United Arab Emirates and became the market leader in premium restaurants, cafés, and hotels. The speaker maintains a long‑standing personal relationship with Mr. Fernando, noting his humility and mentorship, which he says have been passed to second‑generation leader Dilhan and third‑generation leader Amrit. Following Mr. Fernando’s death, the speaker remarks that his absence leaves an unfilled void."
Nature in Conversation in the Netherlands,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb1NoGxIoDM," There's a very special ingredient that illuminates the work of the artisan and that's nature. It's nature that gives brightness to tea, it's nature that gives intensity and flavor, gives the taste adventure. But it's also nature that gives us the possibility to personalize, to enhance teas in different ways. Now that brings me to this beautiful location. And here I am in the Netherlands. And here's Kira. It's a pleasure to meet you. You have a beautiful garden. Thank you. So nice to meet you too. I'd like to know a little bit more about what you're doing here. Do you think you could show me around a little bit? Yes, well we have a very special sage which is called in Dutch Bontesali which means a colourful sage and it's a different type of sage than the usual sage that we use in cooking. It's minty, it's complex, it's got a little citrus. It's beautiful, that's fantastic. Now let's go and have a look at your rosemary. I think the wonder of rosemary is also the fact that it is so good for human health, for cognitive ability. What is it about the garden that enthousins you so much It like a communication with nature And I feel the happiest when I in that interaction in connection with nature in that quiet You know, we taste 10,000 teas each week in Sri Lanka. and the incredible thing is from day to day the teas change because of rainfall of sunshine and this is the beauty and I really value your comment about communication with nature because it is that and it is that nature the influence of nature in what we do that makes it so very special but thank you Kira. You're welcome, thank you. So in this cup I have a combination of the nature, the people, the heritage of Sri Lanka and our tea making tradition taking us back to a different time. But also I have a connection with the nature here in the Netherlands and this beauty that surrounds us. And that combination of taste is what makes tea so extraordinarily special. Nature, the fingerprint of nature, goodness, anti-stress and so much more. Who can think of something greater? Cheers.",Success,"The speaker, while in the Netherlands, meets Kira, who tends a garden featuring a Dutch sage called Bontesali (“colorful sage”) and rosemary noted for cognitive health benefits. They discuss how nature influences tea characteristics, citing that the speaker’s company samples 10,000 teas weekly in Sri Lanka, with flavor variations driven by rainfall and sunshine. The conversation emphasizes a “communication with nature” that links the Dutch garden’s herbs to the heritage and anti‑stress qualities of Sri Lankan tea. The combined sensory profile is presented as a distinctive product of both locales."
"Dilmah: 40 years, 40 stories - Daron Curtiss",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbN90W95iPE," Once you test my Dilma, you test... It was 1992. I get a call from a Meryl J. Fernando. He was casting for an advertising agency in New Zealand. I said, okay, how about coming into the agency and talking to us? And when he arrived, I asked him, how did you find out about us? He said, oh, I found you in the yellow pages. And I said, Meryl, I really need time with you. We need time for you to tell you a story, to get a feel for the tea industry. We knew little about it. So Meryl gave us his time, talked about the tea industry, and from that we gained a lot of information and, importantly, a lot of feel for Meryl and what Meryl was like as a person. So when Meryl came back the next time, we presented him with television commercial, magazine advertisements, and the suggestion that he promotes his own brand. Meryl's personality and the way that he spoke passionately about Dilma was something no actor, no one else could do. Meryl was very reluctant to go on television. And so he said, I'm away for a few days down on the South Island. When I come back, I'll give you my decision. So when Meryl came back he said he'd be happy to do the television commercial and what he said is I'm here for another three days, you need to do it then. Of course getting a crew together in three days and a location, a script that was signed off by TVNZ it was a bit of work to be done and it was Easter We presented him with the location and the script and he changed one or two words and he sat down on the couch and started with his television commercial I have devoted 43 years of my life. At first he was rushing, you know, he was very passionate about his brand. He wanted to sell his product and he started off very quickly and so we had to stop him and get him to calm down, slow down and deliver that real lovely delivery that he's got in his voice. Beautiful timber. So when Meryl was halfway through he stopped, he changed a few more words and then he carried on delivering his natural delivery to camera. I promise to give you the best salon tea. It was wonderful. During our meetings we'd also put to him about a line he would say to us was try it, you must try it. And to customers we'd hear him say try it, you must try it. So we shortened that down to do try it. Do try it. And so that was the first time Meryl delivered his line to TV in 1994. And since then, the brand has grown from strength to strength, and we're proud to be part of it. Now, here we are today celebrating 40 years of Dilma. Meryl's family is following in his footsteps. They continue in the tradition of making the world a better tea and making a stand for quality, for taste, for humanity and a better world. As my friend Meryl would say with a cup of duma in his hand, do try it.",Success,"In 1992 the agency received a call from Meryl J. Fernando, who had found them in the Yellow Pages while seeking work for a New Zealand advertising campaign. After briefing him on the tea industry, the agency produced television and magazine concepts and invited Fernando to promote his own brand, culminating in a rushed three‑day shoot in 1994 with a script approved by TVNZ that featured his line “I have devoted 43 years of my life” and the shortened slogan “do try it.” The commercial aired in 1994, after which the Dilma tea brand experienced sustained growth and is now marking its 40th anniversary. Fernando’s family continues to manage the brand, emphasizing quality, taste, and social responsibility."
When a Tea Garden Becomes a Forest Again,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ekz68g6swrE," In the lush hills of Ratnapur, Sri Lanka, tea plantations weave through patches of fragmented lowland tropical forest. Nearby, the Singharaja Forest Reserve complex, one of the island's last pristine rainforest and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stands as a reminder of what remains of Sri Lanka's primary tropical forests. But even this stronghold does not escape the effects of fragmentation. Amidst this landscape of loss and resilience, a unique reforestation effort is taking root. Inspired by the vision of the late Meryl J. Fernando, founder of Dilma Tea and a passionate advocate for environmental stewardship, this initiative seeks to restore the land now shaped by tea. Led by a dedicated team of Sri Lankan ecologists and forestry experts and supported by Dilma Frank Linia Foundation and Rajarata University of Sri Lanka, the project aims to reconnect two isolated forest reserves, Niharakhanda and Valanghanda. Their mission? To establish a three-kilometer long biodiversity corridor that will give rare and endangered plant and animal species a chance to thrive once more. Walangkhanda Forest Reserve, one of the two forest patches connected by the Andhāna Biodiversity Corridor, borders one of Sri Lanka's largest and vital rainforests, the Singaraja Rainforest Complex, a biodiversity hotspot. Professor Nimal Gunatilaka, the co-lead scientist on the Andhana project, has devoted his life to studying the biodiversity and historical changes of these lowland tropical forests in southwestern Sri Lanka. So the British started clearing the highland forest and they introduced agricultural plantations starting with coffee in the early part of 19th century. And this continued in the highlands to start with, and gradually they shifted or moved down to lowlands with introduction of tea, rubber, and coconut as time went by. So in the early 20th century, much of this lowland areas, especially the rainforest, have been cleared for cultivation of tea and rubber. According to the British sources available, in the latter part of the 19th century, there was about 70% of the forest cover in the island. However, by about 1920, it was reduced to about 50%. Half of that's gone, mostly for plantation agriculture. Professor Gunadilika's research has played a valuable role in shaping the reforestation approach of the Andana Biodiversity Corridor. He is joined by Professor Nalaka Giki Anage, who serves as the project's lead scientist. I arrived at this enormous tree garden of Andana Tea Estate and the site looked very challenging and lots of possibilities and opportunities At the same time it was just next to Singharaja World Heritage Site and on the other hand in the front side we had Iharakandha proposed forest reserve In between we have Andana Tea Garden as well as a community where they have been cultivating their home gardens for hundreds of years. Andhraanatiya state residents and local villages in Belwala, Ratnipura have long shared a close connection with forests. Getting them involved in the project has been key to ensuring its sustainability over the long term.

A third of the Andhana Biodiversity Corridor comprises of the village home gardens. In contrast to the team monoculture of the estate, these gardens possess a high plant diversity and the Andhana Biodiversity Corridor project team are helping the community improve them so that their structure and functions are similar to the forest and can merge into to the biodiversity corridor. In this landscape, we value the ecosystem service values using a toolbox. We considered how much soil conservation measures they apply and how many types of species of trees do they cultivate in their home gardens, how many of them are of utility species, and how many of them are of the common value or rainforest species. At the same time, we considered the vertical stratification or the layering of the home garden because we wanted to mimic these home gardens to the rainforest ecosystem, at least from the functions and the ecosystem services they provide. Having considered these values, we came up with the value for each and every home garden. And based on that, we awarded some of the home gardens with cash awards for preserving and maintaining their home gardens as agri-part. Livelihood opportunities like sustainable beekeeping empower communities to take greater ownership in protecting and sustaining the forest. With the help of some undergraduate students we realized that we can do beekeeping successfully here. We conducted several workshops, training, farmer days and different activities related to beekeeping and then we introduced some bee colonies to this biodiversity corridor and they are having The features of the beekeeping project in the Andar Biodiversity Corridor, we didn't bring colonies from the outside, we used the bee strain found in this area and also this bee colony is actually very helpful to maintain the biodiversity and ecosystem stability in this biodiversity corridor. The nursery is among the few in the country cultivating such a wide range of threatened plant species for restoration. Moreaciehistoire Even in the past 60 years We were E ingenua I have been able to do this. I have been able to do this. I have been able to do this. I have been able to do this. I have been able to do this. Dr. Himesh Straassinger is a dedicated plant biodiversity researcher who scours forests of Sri Lanka, researching rare, threatened and endangered species of plants and trees of Sri Lanka. He joined the Andana team as a tree identification expert. On their field surveys that extended beyond the project site, they discovered several species of rare plants, some of them that were thought to be previously extinct. In the past, we have found the tree tree. We have found the tree tree tree. They actually work their organisation through their coping infrastructure and toстаточно toちは actualising property. Let them know that just lessjälp this picnic has picked 3 steps. And how do we survive the floodgates? It was a very difficult time to do it. It was a very difficult time to do it. It was a very difficult time to do it. It was a difficult time to do it. These techniques have enabled the project to sustain over 80% survival rate. Another important finding of our research in Singharaj was that tree species in particular are not distributed in a random way but they show affinities to specific habitats. There are species which are restricted to ridgetops and upper hill slopes and lower slopes and valleys. So this is quite important in restoration purposes because you cannot plant the species that show affinities to valley bottoms on ridge tops. Similarly, ridge top species shouldn't be planted in the valley bottoms. We have to identify the species that are most suitable for their habitat if you are restoring these endemic tree species which are threatened. So that's a very important factor which we have now fine-tuned and we are using in the restoration model in the Valangkandha area. And I must say that it shows promising results after four years of planting. Initial growth statistics are quite impressive. From標準 value, they made their two��ary priorities that are separate from three to 3 locations. They took a Brasilian holiday by smokingčà and wine with some catering. Bldjee Stapada colocar our촉s brings them into a city with discipleship inside our own period. The corridor was originally the vision of Dilma T founder and philanthropist, Meril J Fernando, who dreamed of restoring the land that had become degraded due to centuries of plantation agriculture On 1st January 2018 my father Dilma founder Meril J Fernando made a very symbolic gesture He began the process of uprooting tea plants on our Endana tea garden to create a biodiversity corridor to connect to the fragmented parts of the Sinharaja forest ecosystem. The objective was to enrich biodiversity, species biodiversity, but what it did was it enriched our business. We acknowledge the fact that taste in tea is crafted not by the tea maker, it's crafted by the winds, by the sunshine, by rainfall and all of this beauty of nature. Beyond simply providing monetary support to the project, we engage every step of the project. We collaborated with experts in the field, conducted several biodiversity assessments, initiated restoration projects, conducted several education and awareness sessions through community, collaborated with universities and conducted several research and development programs, and also we implemented several community uplifting programs like beekeeping. From the perspective of Nature by Solution, the Andana Biodiversity Corridor is a prime example how ecological restoration can link with sustainability of the estates. As the sun sets over this emerging corridor, the signs are unmistakable. Green canopy growing once where there was none, birdsong returning, footprints of species long thought lost. For the team, these are more than just outcomes. They are quiet affirmations that say ecological restoration is possible. It has been seven years for this project and we have a long way and long term plan to accomplish. And in the plans ahead, we foresee that the model of Andana could be replicated elsewhere. And recently released Singaraja Landscape Management Plans proposed that there are six clusters of high ecological value and these places identified as potential places for establishing biodiversity corridors like Andam. And the knowledge that we have gained could be shared by the companies, the private sector, the local communities can come forward to work with us for the many years to come. This corridor is more than a path for wildlife. It's a step towards a more sustainable future. A vision that could guide future restoration across South Asia, offering a path for people and nature to thrive together once again. Thank you.",Success,

Fernando, in my mind, is a one in a billion person. It has been a great privilege for me to be part of this wonderful Dilma 40-year story. More importantly, it has been a greater privilege and pleasure to have been associated with the late founder. Meryl G. Fernando out of the 27 years that I have worked for the company to be closely associated with him over the years. Meryl G. Fernando at all times was a tea man. If one should have seen him during his time as the chairman of the company many a times you would notice him in his full white kit with his apron say name Jeff and in the tea room tasting tea and he would always challenge us and say know your tea and know your product very well and this knowledge helped him to not only present the right product but to also build fantastic recipes the delighted consumers and made commercial success and I always remember the style of the late founder where I would call a don say don can say can attitude He never accepted any excuses of not being able to do what was right and what was required by the customer. Even though he was a founder, chairman and CEO, he brought his two sons into the business. With the two sons together, we saw a formidable team. It was wonderful to see the mutual love and respect that they showed to the father and to each other as they became a very strong team that directed and led the Dilma brand. Another element which I will never forget and which gave me a lot of encouragement and motivation was his belief in this country, Sri Lanka or Ceylon. He truly believed in the concept and in the product Ceylon tea. When I first started working with Mr. Vaviljo Fernando, I realized what a great achievement he has made not only for himself or for the brand, but for our country. As he took from this small country, Sri Lanka, a brand to 100 countries across the world.",Success,"Meryl G. Fernando, founder, chairman and CEO of the Dilma tea brand, led the company for 27 years, emphasizing deep product knowledge and rigorous standards. Under his leadership and later together with his two sons, Dilma expanded from Sri Lanka (Ceylon) to export its tea to approximately 100 countries. He was known for personally testing teas in a white kit and apron, using that expertise to develop successful recipes and drive commercial growth. An employee who worked 27 years with the firm described the period as a 40‑year corporate history marked by a “don‑can‑say‑can” attitude and a strong belief in Sri Lankan tea."

A Journey of Authenticity & Innovation – Dilmah Australia 2025,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1Y1zhtgzM," For 40 years I've been visiting Australia, mostly with my father. We always talked about authenticity, we talked about tea growers, we talked about the passion, we talked about soils and we talked about the fingerprint of nature. And this time, 40 years since my father first launched Dilma, we're talking about innovation. but innovation that's grounded in authenticity, grounded in the passion of tea growers, in our quest for stewardship of soils, of livelihoods and all of those great things that form the definition of value, the 21st century definition. Not value as in the case of discounts and price, but true value. Value expressed in significance, the lives of people, their soils, the biodiversity, and all of those great things. Our commitment as tea growers is to offer you a combination of innovation, authenticity, respect for nature, tradition, natural wellness, all of those things that make tea the greatest herb the world has ever known.",Success,"The speaker has visited Australia for 40 years, initially with his father, who launched the tea brand Dilma. Their discussions have centered on authenticity, tea growers, soil stewardship, and the ecological “fingerprint” of nature. They now emphasize innovation that remains grounded in these authentic practices and in preserving biodiversity, livelihoods, and soil health. The growers’ commitment is to deliver tea that integrates innovation, tradition, natural wellness, and respect for the environment."
"Dilmah: 40 years, 40 stories - John Burton",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMjfnVdZO7Q," 1985 our Labour government disbanded all the import controls and therefore you could start bringing in tea bags. Previously it was just tea chairs so I immediately went to Merrill we started selling his tea bags under the supermarket labels. We were doing a really good business. But then in about 1988, Meryl said to me, look, there's no real future in bulk tea. You know, you're doing well on the tea bags. Why don't we set up a new brand? And I said, look, you must be joking. We can't do that in our market. It's so difficult with all the other competitors. So Meryl said, no, no, can you please do this? And I agreed. So I was probably aged 29 and he was aged 59. And most people at 59 are thinking about retortaring, but no, no, not Meryl. So then we started preparing ourselves. He'd just started in Australia. We started increasing sales. Why? You ask why? Because the quality of the tea from Meryl was spectacular. We used to be able to sell it because we could say to them, it's the tea that you remembered, not a blended, it was a pure Sri Lankan tea. If you go back over our history, most of our teas did come from Sri Lanka and Meryl was just bringing them the tea they remembered. Now what we did in 95 was quite spectacular we started to put Merrill on the screen Do try it And that when the do try it ad came into place 1995, 30 years ago. Why I know it, because it's the year I got paralyzed. Anyway, that didn't stop us. And then our sales started to improve. 9% market share, 15% market share. And you know, things started to move. And then we became market leader. Gosh, that was an immensely proud moment. Because I was the one who said to me, you'll be mad because of these. But no, no, we became market leader. And we've been the market leader for over 15 years now. You know, Meryl didn't take no for an answer. He was certainly strong in his views. He had very good tea. He said what he was going to do. and I got on very well with them. You know, we formed Duma New Zealand and that was the starting point. And our families are very proud of the change of the generation, of the legacy Merrill has created, and especially in our two families and the way we move forward. We'll be involving my daughter who works in the business And, you know, we will use her to take the generational change forward. Most of my staff on the Doolmaar side have been with me for a very long time because they understand the company, they understand its philosophy, and they like it. They like what's going on, and they like what Doolhaan is now trying to do.",Success,"In 1985 the UK Labour government removed import controls, enabling the speaker’s company to sell Merrill’s tea bags under supermarket labels. After Merrill proposed a new pure‑Sri‑Lankan tea brand in 1988, the partners (aged 29 and 59) launched it, and in 1995 a “Do Try It” television campaign boosted sales, raising market share from 9 % to 15 % and establishing the brand as the New Zealand market leader for more than 15 years. The business later formed Duma New Zealand and is planning a generational transition that includes the founder’s daughter.

I remember that in 1990, Mario Fernando came with his very young son, Dilhan to our country and he said, son, this is to be your market. Take care of it. And this is how our history began. For the first time I came to Sri Lanka, I visited factory at Maligavate. and it was at that time the main place where Dilma was produced. Then there were beautiful occasions that we witnessed as a company when new products were launched, which became very important also for our company in Poland. It was T Nexty exceptional We witnessed also the first School of Clean in France in Paul Bocuse Institute. These were very important milestones for Dilma company and I'm very proud and happy that at that time I could witness these events. Mario Fernando was a very nice person. Not only businessman, but he always was interested in what is happening with other people. He wanted always to help. The main thing is to understand the world around, understand our customers, and learn what they require, what they want, because otherwise there is no business, there is no success in trade. I also implemented it in our company. This is the line that we keep. We always think about the people and we think how we can help them.",Success,"In 1990 Mario Fernando arrived in Sri Lanka with his son Dilhan, establishing the market that became the foundation of the Dilma company.

"Future of Tea:  A Journey of Taste, Wellness & Artistry at Hilton Singapore Orchard",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2goZqiVjNk," Tea is rich with stories of great taste, goodness, the fingerprint of nature, the ultimate luxury. We're here in Singapore at the Hilton Orchard and we are talking tea, explaining to tea drinkers, to customers. How valuable is tea? When you look at value in a 21st century context, it's taste of course, but it's also the way tea elevates fine food. It's the way tea enhances gut health. It's the way tea contributes to managing stress and all of those things, but also giving joy, but never forgetting the fact that each cup becomes a cup of kindness because it embodies It carries in the aroma and the flavour. It carries the livelihoods. It carries the soils. It carries all of this that we as tea growers cherish. So my research focuses on flavonoids, which are the naturally occurring compounds present in tea. These compounds, once they're absorbed into the body, they fight inflammation. The latest science is showing us that drinking tea is now linked with slower or less biological aging and that those that drink tea have a lower risk of major types of chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease and dementia. So how many cups does science recommend to drink each day? Well the data shows us that around 2-3 cups per day is what you need to gain the health benefits.",Success,"The discussion took place in Singapore at the Hilton Orchard, focusing on tea’s sensory qualities, culinary pairing, gut‑health benefits, stress mitigation, and socioeconomic impact for growers. The speaker’s research centers on tea flavonoids, naturally occurring compounds that, when absorbed, reduce inflammation and are associated with slower biological aging. Recent scientific evidence links regular tea consumption to a lower risk of major chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and dementia. Epidemiological data suggest that drinking two to three cups of tea daily provides these health benefits."

And by that time, the do try it phrase was coined. And he used to just politely invite some of these shoppers at that time to do try it with a giggle at the same time Other things that that I recall from this remarkable man was the the odd phone call at three o in the morning and I'd answer the phone no mobile phones again back then I'd answer the landline and Mr. Fernando would be at the other end saying Nigel I'd like you to organise a promotion. I'd like you to do this, I'd like you to do that. And I said, Meryl, it's three o'clock in the morning. And he said, oh, oh. Oh, well, now that you're awake, then we can carry on with the business plan. And that was fine by me because the way and the humour that he had with things was quite fantastic.

Now as tea makers and tea tasters, we get that every day. This in particular is one that we made with a lot of love on Craighead Estate. We have this really elegant green tea. So you hand pick, there's no processing at all, it's completely handmade. As the water is being absorbed and the tea giving off its taste and its goodness, This is a unique tea because this year, Andrea, we celebrate 40 years since my father first launched Dilma. It was an achievement because more than anything, at that time, we Sri Lankans, we weren't even allowed to taste tea. So my father broke the mold and he fought for 35 years.

It's not easy to make tea like this. You need the perfect leaf, you need the perfect weather and the process it just takes so long. This is so pure. I love it.

Dilmah’s Dream Escape to Resplendent Ceylon with SriLankan Airlines,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M481hMktnRc," Okay, this is important to your last chance to enter Dilma's dream escape with the competition closing today at 3 p.m. Eastern It's all thanks to our partners at Dilma who are giving away 20 trips for two to stunning Sri Lanka Now not only will you get to stay in some of the world's most luxurious resorts But you'll also get there in style flying with the incredible crew on board Sri Lankan Airlines Okay, I'm here I've arrived I am off to a destination that is on every Australian's bucket list Sri Lanka it's on the radar it's so hot right now and I cannot wait to experience everything that this fabulous country has to offer starting right now I'm traveling with the national carrier Sri Lankan Airlines thank you so much it is non-stop Sydney to Colombo let's go Oh! Come fly with me. I like that. Okay. Thank you. Come fly with me. Oh, that would be lovely. Thank you. Beautiful. Thanks so much. Enjoy your drink and have a good flight. How long's the flight? It's about 10 hours 30. 10 hours 30. Perfect. I'm just going to settle into my journey of flavours. A sleep mask. Larry always says I need my beauty sleep. So 10 and a half hours, easy. I'll see you on the other side. So I touched down in Colombo last night, a dream flight, and I'm back at the airport this morning with Captain Lenny from Sri Lankan Airlines. Hello. How are you? You were right behind us last night. Oh yeah that right I flew from Melbourne to Sri Lanka and we were actually in front of you about 10 minutes ahead of you into Colombo Can we talk about where we standing This is pretty awesome We in the hangar Yeah And the plane I came in on was I think… Something similar to that. A 330. 330. What about, what were you on? I was on a 330-300 and most of the flights that go to Australia are 330-200. So this is where we do most of our maintenance. You can see everybody running around, you know, because these aircrafts are due back the system and on the network. So, Colombo, where we're standing now, this is your hometown. Absolutely. What do we need to know about coming to Colombo, about coming to Sri Lanka? Okay, so I would say any tourist coming to Sri Lanka they feel very homely when they step out of the airport. There's a lot of culture here that I think we can offer in Sri Lanka. We are very friendly people and there's so much to see in Colombo itself. There's a lot of nightlife, there's a lot of hotels, good food, we have a very diverse... Oh, I've only had breakfast and I can absolutely say the food is top notch. And then what about Sri Lanka as a whole, animals? Oh yeah, we've got a lot of wildlife, we've got lots of elephants, you can see leopards, lots of birds. So it's a very family oriented country and you can walk on any street, it's very safe and I would say one of the most affordable destinations in this region. Talk us through the onboard experience. I mean you're up the front. Yeah. Do you know what's going on back? Absolutely. I think you know what's going on at the back. But then what I would like to say is when you, like I said before, when you get on board Sri Lankan, we want to give that experience that you've already entered Sri Lanka. So our crew they naturally very hospitable and they very friendly They beautiful Oh yeah And I would say they what keeps this airline alive you know And they go that extra mile. One of the greatest things is the direct connectivity and also the fact that you leave Sydney in the afternoon and you get to Sri Lanka in the night where you have a good night's rest and then you start off your holiday immediately. So I think that connectivity is also a plus point. After 24 years of flying with Sri Lankan Airlines, Captain Lenny was the perfect person to bring me up to speed in their state-of-the-art simulator. I do like to be in control. I just asked Larry. So is that going to be a problem? No, shouldn't be a problem. It's a simulator. OK. Wow, thank you. They do call me Maverick. Have I ever told you that? Yes, that's my nickname. Can you see the speed increasing? I can feel it, yes. You can feel the speed increase, right? Is this how fast we'd normally be going? Yep. This is really fast. Yes, you don't feel it at the back, but here in front you see it, so you feel it. Bring the nose up. Bring the nose up. A little bit more. Bring, bring, bring. Pull it up. Yep, yep, yep. There you go. You're getting airborne. Yep. Oh, I'm away. Yep. You just took off. Oh, okay, now I can only see the sky. Now can you see the little two green bars? Yes. Now bring your nose down to the bar. There you go. Yeah, there we go. Oh, you're a natural. This is so realistic honestly. So the greenery is back so we're in Colombo we're on approach.

Now bring it up. 30 Up 20 Retard 10 Up Yep Oh we down Are down And we landed Oh we landed I just I just a little bit worried about the braking situation So now we're going to use the feet. Yep. The top of the pedals there. Yep. And you're going to press down on that and that's going to bring the aircraft to the stop. Oh, look at that. Yeah. Probably shouldn't do it in high heels. We're down. Is it usually a clap? Lenny, Captain Lenny, that was a... It was a pleasure. A beautiful flight. I have nothing but praise and admiration for the amazing work that our pilots do in the skies and keeping us all safe. Thank you. Quickest flight ever from London to Colombo. Wow, Kylie, just remind me again, is it flaps up or flaps down? I'll have to consult my manual. No, you do not. But the high heels were a concern. I was a little bit of trouble breaking. And just confirming, our winners get to fly themselves over, yeah? That's right. Isn't that amazing? That's incredible. It's like, you know when you say an immersive experience? It's that. You probably won't get a chance to be on the simulator, but you will enjoy the service. That was really interesting. Look at you in charge of that big thing. I quite liked it.

Flavour to be complementary : Dilmah Omakase_Flavour compliments,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUugFmP3or0," This is a beef tartar, but it's not totally low actually. I think with this kind of tea, it will match exactly, you know, the complementing. To me, the food, it doesn't have to taste like the tea because you already have the tea as a taste. So a lot of chefs try to match the flavor. Me, the way I think, I want the flavor to be complementary but have this uniformity of flavor. The tea truly prepares the palate when the meat comes the tea is like elevated. It pushes the yakku wood as well, the smoke. The tea and the capace, they work so beautifully. The capace softens the tea And the tea highlights, elevates the carpaccio. And all the different flavors, the oil. If you eat the carpaccio first, if you drink the tea first, highlight it. Beautiful. You're an artist, my friend. Why didn't we do this before? It connects with the tea in a completely different way. I love the two experiences you get. Do try it.",Success,"The speaker explains that a beef tartare is paired with a particular tea, which prepares the palate and complements the meat without needing to replicate its flavor. The tea enhances the yakku‑wood smoke and interacts with the capace, which softens the tea while the tea elevates the carpaccio and its oil. This pairing allows the tea to be consumed before or after the carpaccio, highlighting different flavor aspects. The overall goal is a complementary, uniform flavor profile achieved through the tea‑meat combination."
Tea Gastronomy with Channel 7 Australia ‘s Kylie Gillies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oXLPxvfyRg," Welcome back, the countdown is on for your chance to win with Dilma's dream escape. Only two more days to enter now. The countdown is on, there are so many incredible experiences to tick off the bucket list in Sri Lanka and it could be you taking the journey of a lifetime. Now I sat down with the chairman of Dilma, Dilhan Fernando and his son Amrit who took me on a culinary journey with a tea twist. Amrit, as the grandson of the founder of Dilma Tea, I'm going to assume that you know your way around a teapot. Well, I've been training in the art since the age of nine, so hopefully I have some sort of touch of everything going on here. Absolutely. Take us through what we're going to experience tonight. So what we're doing here is a tea-inspired gastronomy experience where we bring in food and tea together. So this is the goat's cheese salad with fig jam. Absolutely, and what the tea does in this case This brings out the texture in the cheese. It also connects to the sweetness. You should feel it dispersing the fat from the cheese. Dispersing the fat? I might bathe in it. Yeah. No hang on, that's my wine glass. That's right. That's how we present in our tea inspired gastronomy. pour it into a wine glass. So if my husband comes downstairs of morning and I'm sipping from a wine glass, I can say it's okay darling it's English breakfast. Exactly you could do that and a perfect pairing for the hoppers and crab that you're gonna enjoy now. So this is a beautifully fragrant tea It a tea grown at 5 feet above sea level combined with extract of red rose and a little finish of vanilla I can smell that from here Wow It's a perfect pairing with panna cotta. So here you're going to have a very rich and creamy panna cotta with a little bit of cinnamon on it. When you've got the panna cotta in your mouth and you take a sip of the tea, you should feel the tea elevating the panna cotta. and then on the second sip it completely removes all the residual fats and sweetness. That's exactly what it does in your digestive system. My mind is blown that tea can do all of that and that it works so beautifully. Here with this digestive is enhancing digestion but also giving you that fresh lingering jasmine palate. I don't believe I've ever cheered a tea glass before, a cuppa before, but it seems rather fitting. Thank you for the most enjoyable tea gastronomy experience. And I don't think I'll ever look at a cup of tea again the same. Enjoy it. Thank you. I can't help but feel you've come back a bit of a tea snob. I have. You went away a bit of a, oh, chuck it in there. But now you're like, look at it. I know. You need to try your tea out of a wine glass like that. especially say that rose and vanilla with the panna cotta really it's really why don't you take me there one day that'd be nice if you want the chance to win a luxury holiday to beautiful sri lanka thanks to our partners at dilmati you've got to enter now head to themorningshow.com.au and tell us in 25 words or less why you'd love to visit the home of dilmati in sri lanka and how you enjoy your perfect cup of tea and we're going to be announcing our next morning show winner tomorrow.

Tasting Dilmah Watte Series with Chef Andrea Ferrero,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnOcVlAPq20," What we have here to help you with your omakase is my grandfather's Watta series, which goes through a beautiful story right here. So it starts off in the highest terroir in Sri Lanka, is our Nurelia region, Lover's Leaf Garden, and travels through the Dimbula Valley all the way to the coast near Gaul, where we have the Indian Ocean. This one, you can see it has a beautiful light amber colour, floral notes. And what you see as you taste through these, Andrea, what inspired my father and what we're hoping will inspire you, the beautiful distinctiveness of the influence of sunshine, of rainfall, of temperature, of the art of tea growing and tea making. So you have this beautiful, light, bright tea from Lover's Leap Estate. It's Camellia Sinensis, but then so is this, Yatavatta. It's also Camellia Sinensis made in the same method, yet so different. because in tea what you experience on the eye connects with the nose and finally the palate. So here we have a floral, slightly green nose and it's softly astringent, it's a little bit grassy, a little bit green and it has a finish that is quite complex so it delicate and it a big contrast with what we going to taste next so we're starting at 6 500 feet above sea level we're coming down past nanu here we're coming to the dimbula valley where breakfast tea was born the same plant but a very different nose and so you feel more intensity more structure even visually absolutely it starts on the eye completely different so eye nose palette is connected and here more fruity more woody you're getting an edge that is becoming a little bit malty this is the sunshine that you're tasting now we're coming down to raknapura now here in raknapura you have eight hours of sunshine much shorter diagonal range the temperature night and the daytime temperature and you can see on the eye you can see the difference which is even more contrasting with what we saw so you can see that even in comparison with our last tea we have greater intensity so the intensity on the eye matches the intensity on the nose Here you go son Thank you Okay and you feel on the nose you feel the malt yes It's become thicker, and you'll feel it on the palate also, in the side of the tongue, in what we call gut. Texture, chewy. In wine, you call it tannins. In tea, it's polyphenols. Then we come to Yatta Watta. Watta means garden. Yatta is lower, Mada is mid, Uda high and Ran golden. So this was my father's classification. And now a complete contrast, Kofritza. So here you find almost a bitter chocolate and you see the darkness reflected on the nose. It's earthy. So imagine this with meats, with grilled meats, it connects to caramelization, connects to bitter chocolate, connects to its stewed fruit. Completely different. Weight, the mouthfeel, complete contrast. In this room we taste 10 to 12,000 teas each week. Every estate has multiple terroirs because the taste in tea in Camellia Sinensis is brought out by an estimated 300 different elements amino acids etc components so nature she like a like a conductor of an orchestra first violin brightness first violin and here you have the cello you have the trombone you have the intensity the strength and here you have more brightness more structure you've got the second violin you've got that which is right perfect absolutely so Exactly. I mean, this is where we see the relativity and this is the tapestry you have. You know how the tea can develop in so many different flavors within the same plant. And yeah, it's natural. It's natural. So typically, you know, we have, for example, Ron Watt connects sometimes with, say, a black cod and an oily fish, but equally with citrus, with salads. Of course, this is conventional. When you take the tea with a fatty dish, because it emulsifies the fats, immediately on the palate it breaks it down and it dignifies the food. And this is the magic in tea. So you take this with something as simple as chocolate. It breaks the chocolate down. You get the roasted notes, the cocoa notes, you get the almond or whatever is the composition. It brings it up and then with the next sip it cleanses your palate and it also helps the body to manage the insulin. So it helps the body to synthesize sugar, which is great. Do try it.",Success,"The “Watta” tea series, a family line from Sri Lanka, originates in the Nurelia region’s Lover’s Leaf Garden, moves through the Dimbula Valley (the birthplace of breakfast tea) and ends near the Indian Ocean coast at Gaul, with teas ranging from a light amber, floral‑note brew at 6,500 ft to a darker, malt‑rich Kofritza that exhibits bitter chocolate and earthy flavors. The series is classified by altitude—Yatta (low), Mada (mid), Uda (high) and Ran (golden)—and each estate’s multiple terroirs produce distinct visual, aromatic and palate profiles, reflecting roughly 300 chemical components such as amino acids and polyphenols. The tasting room processes 10–12 000 teas weekly, illustrating how variations in sunshine, rainfall, temperature and altitude generate a spectrum of intensity, structure, and mouthfeel.

Across Australia & New Zealand with Tea and Purpose – Dilmah Family Tour,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMJ3Vpg34dg," Celebrating 40 years of Dilma tea as we have been doing in Australia and New Zealand brings into much greater focus the challenges that my father must have experienced when in 1985 he set out to launch what was the world's first producer-owned tea brand the first genuinely ethical tea brand in the world. But what it has done for me is to strengthen my commitment to those founding values, to make a stand for producers, for biodiversity, for taste, for natural goodness and all of the things that my father stood for. So much courage that went into the foundation of our brand. As a third generation that commitment to people and planet is what makes us different, what makes Dilma unique and as the third generation on behalf of my cousins and my brother and sister, we continue to make a pledge to sustain and make a greater impact on the lives of people in Sri Lanka and around the world and nature itself.",Success,"In 1985 the founder launched Dilma tea, the world’s first producer‑owned, ethically focused tea brand, initially serving Australia and New Zealand.

Channel 7 Australia’s visit to the Elephant Transit Home,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yn2ZBmr0xA," Kylie, your Sri Lankan adventures have been phenomenal so far and we've got more stunning stories heading your way. It's all part of our massive competition, Dilma's Dream Escape, where 20 people will win a luxury trip for two to the home of Ceylon Tea. Our partners at Dilma, well they're celebrating 40 years of tea time with Australians and it's thanks to you that they're able to support life-changing projects like the Elephant Transit Home. with 15% of their profits supporting conservation initiatives. So I visited the incredible sanctuary helping to protect the island's endangered elephants. Take a look. One by one, they come running. Orphaned baby elephants excited for their next meal of the day. They're fed five times a day. It's like they wear watches. They know exactly when the milk buffet opens. A four and a half hour drive from the city of Colombo, the elephant transit home in Uduwalaway National Park is a safe haven for these gentle giants. What we are doing here is we collect all the orphan elephants from every part of the country and rehabilitate them and release back to the wild. And when you release them, it's never as an individual. They like to have their friends around. Yes, elephants are, I mean, social animals. We have to release them as a group. So after their feed of milk, they then move... Oh! I don know are they happy with the service I not sure But after the milk they then move on to second course And this is a chance for the public to get an even closer look at these magnificent creatures Many of these elephant calves have suffered trauma in their not-too-distant past. Gunshot wounds, poisoning, electrocution and collisions with trains. So, Dr Sumut, what's the biggest threat to elephants here in Sri Lanka? Well, unfortunately, it's the humans. and the fact that humans are encroaching into elephant habitat. Sadly, some are left with lifetime injuries. We have one elephant with a prosthetic leg. He's the... A prosthetic leg on an elephant? Yes, yes. Now he's a big bull, I mean, it's a young bull. He's now around 15 years old. We found him with a very serious injury to his hind leg, so we amputated his leg and now we manage him with a prosthetic leg. Now he's living with us but unfortunately he can't go back to the wild so we keep him as a permanent member here. What makes these creatures so magnificent as someone who's worked with them for such a long time? Everything. They show courage, they show teamwork, they show empathy. In every way you see how they work very well as a team and we have lots of lessons learned from them. While conservationists plead for coexistence, shrinking forests and human-elephant conflict are doubling elephant deaths in Sri Lanka. We have to start taking action right now, and it all depends on managing their habitat better It all about coexistence Humans and elephants together Together yes Thankfully places like this are doing everything they can to save them Dr Mullica, this is really cool. We're on the edge of the transit home and National Park. Yes. And we see the elephants behind us. Yes. And these are the ones in the process of being gradually weaned back into the wild. Yes. This is our rehabilitating group. Basically they are living inside the national park as a free group. They can find their own food, they can do their natural interactions and they can show their natural behaviours. Dilma Conservation has supported the Elephant Transit Home since 2007, educating local and international visitors on why the Asian elephant needs to be protected. The work of the Dilma Conservation Group, I mean, how important is that? Oh, it's extremely important what Dilma is doing. Dilma Conservation funds many environment conservation projects and their contribution to the elephant transit home is significant. And by sponsoring the care of abandoned elephants like Baby Dilma. Here not only do you get to see the elephants up close, but you also get to learn all about them. Come with me on the Dilma Elephant Knowledge Walk. Here, the Asian elephant, the one that we saw. They grow up to three and a half meters in height. Sadly the number of Asian elephants has halved in the last 100 years And as a mummy this makes me sad The male elephants leave the nest when they about 8 to 10 whereas the female elephants like to hang in the family group. This is the elephant's skin, and it's relatively thin, just 2 to 3 centimetres thick. but the wrinkles, the wrinkles on an elephant skin helps them keep the animal cool by dissipating more heat. See, I knew there was something good about having wrinkles. Wow, what a place. I know, they do such beautiful work. So these orphan elephants that would just die, they bring them in, they get them back up to health and then they send them on their way again. And as you saw, it was just right on the edge of the national park so the elephants just come and go as they're like, They know when it's feeding time. Yeah, I'll bet. Another terrific story. We still have plenty more holidays to Sri Lanka to win. Just head to the morningshow.com.au and in 25 words or less, tell us why you'd love to visit the home of Dilma Tea in Sri Lanka and how you enjoy your perfect cup of tea. Yeah, and speaking of cuppa, when you drink your cup of tea, the 15% of the profits goes back into helping the foundation and the work like that. So when you have your cuppa, it actually helps the elephants. That's a good story. We'll be announcing our next lucky winner within the hour. So stay tuned. It may be you and you could begin to start packing your bags. Do you actually have a watch? No, I don't. Because that's a very Boomer thing to do. Come out within the next hour. Within the next hour.

So that makes 2018 an incredibly important year for this region. Calcutta and neighboring Pasukuda is beautiful, but it's characterized by gender inequality, by a lack of opportunity, which signifies the nearly 30% poverty levels that you have here.

Imagine that over 2,000 families empowered through the Small Entrepreneur Program, little businesses, mentored, connected to markets and helped to lift themselves. And that's where the dignity is because dignity comes not from dependence, not from charity, but dignity comes from a sustainable model where we offer a crutch and at a certain point give the beneficiary the possibility of throwing it away and walking on their own eventually running and finally the only thing we ask is please pay it forward pay it back to somebody who needs help so that we can magnify that philosophy of family business serving humanity",Success,"The Meril J.

Tea Gastronomy with Chef Andrea Ferrero,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUncOV2LGBw," We are artisans of tea and for us, crafting tea or cinnamon, it's about passion. It's about embedding that secret ingredient, the magic that delivers the taste, the goodness, framed in the ethical purpose and that's artisanship. Now when artisans meet, it can be explosive because you have this explosion of creativity, of great taste, of artistry. We first met Andrea Ferrero in 2010. He came across and Chef and the tea maker happened. It was a phenomenon. The tea maker then was my father, Dilma founder, Meril J. Fernando. He's not with us now, but his grandson, my son, Amrit, and his son, I, the second and third generations are here to welcome back to Sri Lanka, Andrea Ferrero. Andrea, welcome. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I'm back. Tell me you participated in 2010 and I was recently in Dubai and I met Jody Jody told me that Chef and the tea maker changed her life I was in awe because we were sharing our love for tea. But what were the impressions? An Italian and tea don't often go well together. But what was your impression? For me it was a great opportunity to discover Sri Lanka and to meet Mr. Fernando first and know about this value, this company value, how he created Dilma, and what is passion and love he has for tea, and the people who make tea for him, which is a very big point for us. And then I had the opportunity also to discover tea from another side, not only as a beverage, but also as an ingredient, and as a new palette of flavor for my food. So it was all in all a great discovery for us. I can never forget Andrea two of the dishes that you did One Sun was extremely artistic It was white tea a Ceylon silver tips which Andrea put into a bread Now you had to have the bread warm The bread was so perfectly crafted. It was artisanal bread. You had to have it warm because the minute it cooled, you lost that beautiful floral character. Tell me, do you remember that? Yes, I remember your father when he saw white tea on the bread. You know, I was so surprised. And then like, yes, I mean, tea is all in all an ingredient itself. It can be used as a beverage, but it can only be introduced in food in order to create new flavor combination to ennase food itself. Remember the other dish. Actually, I think this preceded the white tea bread. It was the drops of frozen tea. And, you know, it was tea that you could eat and you could drink. I remember it like it was this morning sun It was so magic Tell me a little bit about this So obviously I wanted to surprise a little bit the people you know at the dinner And then I was thinking a way of yes you drink the tea but obviously or you use it as an ingredient in the dessert. But I wanted to give this different texture so you can actually chew a cup of tea. It's very unusual. That's interesting. So it pops in your mouth? It was like a little bit of a drop of tea, a drop in liquid nitrogen. And then it became like, basically, ice cream made itself with tea. So that was a compliment itself for the same. And it was beautifully presented. Little droplets of tea and on this amazing... Where was I? You were a little boy. He was a little boy.

The goodness of Dilmah Tea for people and the planet.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2L1wKyBLhc," My father made a promise when he first conceived the idea of our Dilma tea. It was 1950, over 70 years ago. He was a young man who dreamed of a better world. He pledged to offer our country's prized produce tea with the promise of great taste, natural goodness and kindness. The goodness in tea comes from the plant antioxidants that is so abundant in fresh tea. tea. What makes the goodness so valuable is what it does for our health, strengthening our immune system, protecting from cancers and promoting digestive health and a host of other health benefits. And don't forget L-theanine son, that's the amino acid in tea that calms, easing stress, reducing anxiety and sharpening the mind. And there's more because the goodness at the heart of our Dilma tea goes beyond good health. My father promised to be kind and we use our earnings today to construct schools, hospitals, training centres to offer dignity to the less fortunate.

So now to officially kick off the proceedings, I have the honor of inviting a visionary leader, the chairman and the chief executive officer of Dilma Zilanti Company PLC to deliver the welcome note. Dilhan, over to you. The vision I'm hoping will be shared by you later today. Our biodiversity, specifically in the case of Sri Lanka, elephants define our cultural and social identity, increasingly also our economic future. The value of elephants and the species that surround us in a world where many countries lack that blessing and seek it as part of their search for mindfulness, sustainable living all of this I think makes this discussion particularly important In April 2009 together with my father on the instigation of IUCN it was then Shirani Yasaratna who was its country head, we became formally involved with elephants at what is today the Elephant Knowledge Walk. Knowledge of elephants and knowledge of every species connects to an understanding of their value. And the one thing that I hope that we will all take away, of course many of you are eminent in your knowledge and expertise in the area, but for inexpert people like me from the business community, I hope that what we will take away is that nature has the most incredible set of solutions for every economic, social, health and other issues that we have today. I was at a discussion yesterday with several hundred business people on the invitation of Ernst & Young. And what I explained to them is that whilst we are pondering the EU Green Deal, while we are looking at corporate disclosure, etc., all of this has a very simple basis in human behavior. conservation, restoration, finding an equilibrium that is respectful and practical is about doing the right thing. It's really nothing more, nothing less. It's about doing the right thing by people and nature. Why are we involved? We're a tea company. We're involved because we have an enduring connection with nature. It the rainfall that nurtures our crops It the sunshine that gives it intensity it the wind that gives it brightness Over the weekend, we launched an auction for the Uwe Seasonal Flush 2024. If you haven't heard of it, please look it up. It's one of the chief reasons why Ceylon-T became so famous. And you know why the uva seasonal flush is so special? When the monsoon approaches the uva region, the influence of the wind in placing the plants under stress, that desiccating wind produces this wintergreen character. that is priced and unique. One caddy sold for $175, that is 525,000 rupees per kilo. I'm not saying we can sell all 10 kilos of it, but the point is it creates in the mind of the consumer sitting in England, Germany, Netherlands, wherever, creates value for tea, understanding. And what does that value translate into? Translates into this, what we're doing today. Translates into the billion rupees that the MJ Foundation is able to spend building hospitals, building schools, helping our people. Because business has a responsibility to community. Business cannot exist without people, cannot exist without nature. So the importance of elephants as a critical component in that biodiversity that gives us the ability to define an identity for Ceylon tea is the same that will give us an ability to define an identity, uniqueness and a point of difference and command value for Ceylon cinnamon, cashew, clove, cardamom, tourism, etc. People aren coming here to look at our buildings they coming here to appreciate our biodiversity they coming here for experiences I don have the solutions but I believe that you do I really thrilled that Genesis is able to host this conversation because it's the young minds that will help us to frame the solutions for tomorrow. And the interesting thing is that, as I constantly share with my colleagues in business. We need a defined commitment because since 2005 the solutions to the crises that are doubling, tripling cost to business as a result of extreme climatic events, as a result of biodiversity, of course all are interconnected. So I'm framing all of this in our conversation on elephants. All of this we knew what we had to do, we just didn't do it. And so what we can do is It's not the solution. It's not enough, but at least it's a start. Mostly today, the vision to correct my introduction is not mine, but today the vision is yours. And I'm excited and deeply appreciative for the presence of so many such eminent minds in facilitating this discussion. In conclusion, my father, many years ago, saw a different way. He set out very simply to make the world a better tea. And that delivered a Sri Lankan product, staffed and manned by Sri Lankans with Sri Lankan expertise, Sri Lankan resources, that today has the privilege of being in households around the world. I hope that we will find similarly a Sri Lankan solution to this very critical problem, and that that will help us then to understand and realize the value that we have in finding a practical and realistic solution to this human-elephant conflict. Thank you very much. Welcome to Genesis, ladies and gentlemen.",Success,"Dilma Tea, a brand of Dilma Zilanti Company PLC, and its environmental arm Dilma Conservation and Sustainability announced a joint effort to protect Sri Lankan biodiversity, stressing the cultural and economic importance of elephants for"
Seasonal Flush Phenomenon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qsFryGfamo," If ever there was a tea that could claim greatness, this would be it. The Uwe Seasonal Flush 2024 from Dilma. What makes a tea great is the influence of nature, confluence of natural climatic factors. It refers to soil. In ancient times, it was referred to as the influence of heaven and earth and only finally man, that is the art of tea making. The seasonal, monsoonal winds that for a few days only produce extraordinary character in the teas grown in our most rugged Uva region of Sri Lanka. What makes this tea so great? Well, let's find out. You need to make sure that you use just the right amount. Two and a half grams for every 200 mils. Water at 80 degrees, not more. because we don't want to scald the extraordinary aroma in this beautiful tea. And don't forget to stir. Stirring is critical for the tea leaves to be able to give off their flavour, their goodness, the texture, the aroma, but not too much of the aroma while brewing because as the aroma is produced you could lose the volatiles the beautiful flavor in this tea now three minutes is what it takes to make a great black tea so as we wait for the leaf to brew let's talk a little bit about why uva Ceylon tea was known throughout the ages for the emphasis on artisanal manufacture, conservative agricultural practices, science but also refined by the artistry of Ceylon tea makers over the centuries And that translates today into a respect for nature Once brewed, the tea produces the most inspiring golden amber liquor. This is a very special tea. Only 10 kilograms ever made. 100 caddies. Not because it was our plan, but it's the way nature intended. Greatness in tea comes with the permission of nature. And in this case, that greatness is reflected in this beautiful infusion. aroma and flavour well from that golden amber liquor it's extraordinary and the luxury in this tea comes from the knowledge that each leaf handpicked typically 30 handpicked leaves in my cup right now incredible artistry but artistry that is fashioned by nature, fashioned by the wind, by the sunshine, by the light afternoon showers. Artistry that is refined by the art of tea makers following a centuries old tradition that began with Emperor Shen Nung who in 2737 BC first discovered the magic of tea but he discovered it as a medicine and that too, wellness, what a combination. Isn't that a beautiful interpretation of contemporary luxury? No more decadence, but today truly a conscious luxury. I'm honored to present our 2024 Uwe Seasonal Flush. Do try it.",Success,"The Uwe Seasonal Flush 2024, produced by Dilma in Sri Lanka’s rugged Uva region, is a limited‑edition black tea with only 10 kg (100 caddies) ever made. Brewing guidelines specify 2.5 g of tea per 200 ml of water at 80 °C, stirred briefly and steeped for three minutes to preserve volatile aromatics and achieve a golden‑amber liquor. The tea’s character is attributed to seasonal monsoonal winds, soil conditions, and traditional Ceylon artisanal practices that emphasize conservative agriculture and hand‑picking of approximately 30 leaves per cup. Its heritage references the 2737 BC discovery of tea by Emperor Shen Nung, originally as a medicinal remedy."

Tea is no ordinary herb. It was born as a medicine. It evolved into this beverage with incredible diversity and the fingerprint of nature, what you call terroir in many industries. But that translates to a spectrum of taste, of appearance, a spectrum of possibilities in pairing and dignifying food. But remarkably, all underlined by that promise of goodness, digestive health, mental health, heart and so much more, reducing the impact of stress on the human body. That's what we present at the Dilma School of Tea and at our tea appreciation today in the Maldives, we hope to inspire hospitality professionals to understand how tea can go beyond, how tea can be a perfect welcome, a perfect accompaniment to mindful meetings, to spas, to every aspect of a guest experience in hospitality, but more as a tea for every mood, every occasion and every aspect of life. Come join us.",Success,"The Dilma School of Tea hosted a Tea Appreciation Session in the Maldives aimed at hospitality operators, consumers, and tea drinkers.

Studying presence of Ammonia in South Asian Forests by Prof Mark Sutton,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgXgKsfrF5Y," What is the problem? We don't worry about nitrogen pollution because if nitrogen is 78% of our atmosphere as N2, what is the problem? Of course, nitrogen is unreactive in that form, but through our human activities we've converted it into what we call reactive nitrogen forms. That's nitrogen, hydrogen, ammonia, nitrogen, oxygen, nitrates, and lots of other forms. So an amino acid is a carbon chain with nitrogen and two hydrogens. Proteins take that on board. And so we end up with nitrogen being the stuff of life. DNA is a nitrogen molecule. All the enzymes in our bodies are nitrogen molecules. So if carbon is the structure of life, then nitrogen is what is giving us diversity in life. How many nitrogen molecules are on the planet? It's impossible to answer because every DNA molecule is a different nitrogen compound. So billions, billions, billions of different nitrogen compounds. Now, the problem is in our human endeavor to make those nitrogen compounds, we're extremely wasteful. That means that when we are turning atmospheric nitrogen into fertilizers, for example, in the Harbour Bosch process, and then using those fertilizers to grow food, feeding ourselves, but also feeding livestock and then eating the livestock. That means we have a very wasteful system with roughly 80% of that nitrogen resource being wasted. Only 20% ends up being used perfectly. So it means we have a problem with nitrogen pollution, we have a problem with low efficiency. Now, if we compare nitrogen and carbon, carbon is really, as we know, a climate issue. Carbon dioxide and methane as well are both climate warming gases. But nitrogen is multiple dimensions. It's contributing to water pollution as nitrate in water and organic nitrogen compounds. It's contributing to air pollution this fine particulate matter and affecting ecosystems. It's affecting greenhouse gas balance with the nitrous oxide, that's laughing gas emissions. In terms of ecosystems, it's affecting forests, affecting fresh waters. All ecosystems are affected by nitrogen. Probably somewhere on the planet, there might be something really clean, which is not much affected, but many places across the planet affected. And of course, it's mediated through changes in soils as well as changing nitrogen. Too much nitrogen affects soil quality. Too little nitrogen in agricultural soils if we take out more than we put in then we have a problem Now in terms of that waste of resources it also an economic waste of money So if we take the total value of nitrogen wasted to air and water we get about 200 million tons. If we multiply that by one and a half dollars per kilogram nitrogen we get about 300 sorry, $600 billion worth of nitrogen wasted resource. Now, in the Colombo Declaration, which was agreed in your city in 2019, governments made an agreement to have the ambition to halve nitrogen waste by 2030. That would be effectively at today's prices, saving around 300 billion US dollars a year worth of resources. So why don't we do it? Why not take this obvious action? And I think it's back to this fragmentation of issues where nitrogen is a little part of everybody's problem, but we don't necessarily see the big picture. So we need to make it more visible. We need events like this to raise awareness of the importance of nitrogen pollution in its many dimensions if everybody's going to be motivated to act. So I want to come on now to talk about one form of nitrogen pollution, which we've been studying at the Dilma Climate Change Research Centre at Rila Gala Forest. And that is ammonia. Ammonia is one nitrogen and three hydrogens, NH3. It's an alkali and it's a form, basis form of nutrients. So amino acids, amines, etc. So with ammonia and ammonium, that's with four hydrogens in your soil, then plants can grow and make nutrients. But the question is how much? Too much, too little? If it's too much, we then affect sensitive biodiversity that's vulnerable to that too much ammonia. And not to forget, the ammonia is having other effects, effects forming fine particulate matter in the atmosphere. So ammonia is an alkali together with nitric acid and sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, forming salts, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate. And with other parts of particulate matter, those get deep inside our airways, shortening lives. Now, we, as I think you will have heard from Professor Nisanka, have been taking part in this South Asian nitrogen hub. all eight countries across South Asia. That means we've been looking at nitrogen in policies, nitrogen in agronomic solutions and in industrial solutions. We've been looking to raise awareness by studying key threats and we been studying the flows Now when it came to studying those key threats we selected two systems the forests and the coral reefs And why do that Basically because South Asia is a hotspot of nitrogen pollution and we think that both of those ecosystems are understudied. And there's a parallel between those, particularly with the lichens as indicators of air pollution growing on the forests. Now, perhaps you can just about see the tree behind me. The light isn't very good, But on that tree trunk are really happily growing lichens. And I'm in the clean part of Scotland with a rich biodiversity of lichens on the forests. It's an indicator of good tree health. But if I went to a more agricultural part of Scotland, then those lichens would be different. We'd see the fingerprint of air pollution having its effects. Now, if we compare the study that's been going on in Scotland, there's much more data on air quality and lichens in Scotland. And so our South Asian nitrogen hub has been bringing new evidence forward to try to understand that with two parts. The first part is looking at lichens in the Himalayan zone, the sub-Himalayan forests, with the Indo-Gandetic plain being a real hot spot of nitrogen pollution. The trees are standing with their feet in nitrogen air pollution and we expect with substantial effects. So we've been looking at the distribution of ammonia, the distributions of lichens. We're currently putting those data sets together to understand the scale of that impact. But we also wanted to look experimentally. We looked long and hard to find a site suitable for doing those experimental studies. And I'm very happy to say that with the introduction from Gotham, from the Natural History Museum, who's together with you today at Dilma, we found a great site in the Dilma Climate Change Research Centre. Without your endeavours there in establishing that centre high up on the top of the hill, it simply wouldn't be possible to do this experiment. So we had expected to do it in the sub-Himalayan zone. We found ourselves doing it in the Sri Lankan highlands. We're very happy to be there. So that experiment is proceeding. I think others after me, Ajinkia, Boudicca, Maud and others will tell you more about how that experiment is getting on and the results we're seeing from it. But what I can tell you is that this is critical evidence for us already showing that the lichens are sensitive to ammonia pollution in Sri Lanka, just as they are in the Himalayan zone, just as they are in the UK, and that this is a key signal for biodiversity change if we worried about our natural habitats And remember that is a litmus test of change because when you see the lichens changing the whole ecosystem function is changing, there'll be changes in soils, emissions of greenhouse gases, water quality issues, the whole nitrogen cycle being changed. So this is a really important test. So let's come on then to talk about solutions. I understand that Professor Nisanka will have told you some of his favourites. The point I want to make here about solutions is that there's an opportunity, particularly in agriculture, to farm better. And we're really happy to be working with you and Dilma on this and look further forward to building our conversations on how, for example, fertiliser use in Sri Lanka can be optimised more effectively. Now, a few years ago, you will know that a former president banned fertilizers in Sri Lanka. At the same time, in another policy film, I was working with the Ministry of Environment of Sri Lanka. We put forward a resolution to the United Nations Environment Assembly, building on the Colombo Declaration. That was not proposing to ban fertilizers. It was rather saying to halve that nitrogen waste. And what we mean is if you halve those losses to air, land and water, more is going to be available for your crop. So no target to reduce fertilizer inputs, but rather a target to reduce the losses. And when reducing the losses, then of course, there's an opportunity to save on the inputs because not so much fertilizer will be needed. a more efficient system saves money and good for the environment. So that points towards not only those methods we need, for example, fertilizer deep placement or urease inhibitors or nitrification inhibitors, different timing, but it also points towards the need to measure the system to find ways of cheap sampling of soil quality so that farmers can have more confidence that they don't need to apply excessive fertilizer use. So good for the pocket, good for the environment. I think here this is an opportunity for Dilma to play another leading role in the future, sharing with others across Sri Lanka, not just in the forest site, but in terms of rolling out and demonstrating those good agricultural practices. So I think I've come to the end of the time here and I just want to wish you well as you meet and discuss. It's a pleasure to be working with you with Dilma. As I say, without you, we couldn't do it. Thank you, Rishan, for hosting us. Thank you, Ashan, for managing the call and I look forward to speaking with you in person further when I'm next in Sri Lanka. Thank you. Thank you.",Success,"Nitrogen is transformed from inert atmospheric N₂ into reactive forms (e.g., ammonia, nitrates) through the Haber‑Bosch process, but about 80 % of the resulting fertilizer nitrogen is wasted, amounting to roughly 200 million t and an economic loss of ≈ US $600 billion; the 2019 Colombo Declaration set a target to halve this waste by 2030, potentially saving ≈ US $300 billion annually. In South Asia, excess reactive nitrogen—particularly ammonia (NH₃)—drives water, air, and soil pollution, contributes to nitrous‑oxide greenhouse‑gas emissions, and harms ecosystems such as Himalayan forests and coral reefs, as evidenced by ammonia‑sensitive lichens observed in both the Sri Lankan highlands (Dilma Climate Change Research Centre) and the UK. The South Asian Nitrogen Hub, involving eight countries and researchers like Professor Nisanka, is mapping ammonia and lichen distributions and conducting field experiments to quantify ecosystem impacts.

Business Support for Scientific Research  by Buddhika Weerakoon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWp_Gdrp1Ts," We have a brief idea about how the nitrogen pollution and the problematic nitrogen is and also how lichens can be used as bio-indicators to assess the air quality and the nitrogen pollution. So let me go to my presentation. presentation is about briefing about the how our study had contributed to study the air pollution indicators using as indicators so this is the content of my presentation basically it has three segments three segments so first i will go through about brief introduction about our study and then Then as the second part, what we have received from Dilma, the support we received from Dilma, and also as the last segment of the presentation, the achievements of our project. So our study has done in the Rilagal Conservation Forest, which is close to the Dilma Climate Centre at the Nava Lepitya. So the forest is located at Nava Lepitya area, basically bordering to Kandy and New Orleans districts. And the extent of the forest is 209 hectares and it is surrounded by intensively managed tea cultivation, tea plantations. So basically The closest access to the forest is the Queensbury estate of the Kahawatt plantations of Dilma. So we have identified a sampling area which is close to the peripari of peripheral area of the forest, the relagal forest. We have demarcated a sampling flood for this study. So the extent of the sampling plot is, it is 120 meters in length and 40 meters in width. So we have divided that sampling plot, the main area, into 5 meter by 5 meter subunits. So it is basically, we divided it to the EC2 sampling. And so we have 192 subunits in our sampling plot and we have selected a concentrated area, the middle part of the sampling plot for the experimental process. So we have 60 meter by 20 meter area for the experimental area. So we have 48 subunits for the experimental area. and also we do have control plots. So we have 11 control plots at the very margin of the main sampling plot. So here you can see this diagram will show you how our plots lay out in the sampling area. So at the middle of the main sampling plot we have established meteorological tower and the ammonia enhancement system So Ajinkya has explained you about the meteorological tower and also we do have a ammonia enhancement system at the middle of the sampling plot so the system is 20 meter in length and it will emit ammonia to the environment it is bidirectional emission and also the emission is depend on the it is related to the wind speed and the wind direction. We have done a preliminary survey before we start the experiment. So we have identified the trees which has 5 cm above dB h for the future measurements. So we have measured the dB h of each tree within the 120 by 40 meter area and we have tagged those trees with the unique number. and we have measured the lichen, we have monitored the lichen which are on those trees. So, as I mentioned earlier, at the middle of the main sampling plot, the experimental area, we have measured the lichen which is covering from ground level to 2 meters in height, and we have recorded them for the long-term monitoring. And also we have measured the canopy cover of each tree we are using for measure lichen diversity. And also we have measured the tree height. So we have measured the tree height using the pole method. And also we have used the densiometers for measure the canopy cover of each tree. and this is how our ammonia enhancement system looks like so it is consists with three live it has three level emission so it is made with PVC tubes and it it is connected to the ammonia cylinder and ammonia cylinder get the signal from the meteorological tower and it the the signal will release the ammonia to the pipe system and it will mix with the mixed with the ambient air and the mixed air and mixed air will be released to the environment and it will increase the concentration of the surrounding area and also we are using alpha samplers to measure the ammonia concentration at each identified locations. So we have a set of alpha samplers within our sampling plot. So we can get an idea about how ammonia dispersion happened within the plot. And then we started the lichen monitoring. So initially we have done main survey preliminary survey as I mentioned you earlier we monitored and we recorded lichens from ground level to two meters in height and we have selected some lichens for long term monitoring So altogether we have selected 169 lichen telli for long-term monitoring in the experimental area, experimental 48 subplots, and also 48 lichen telli from the control subplots, 11 control subplots. So you can see here in the middle picture down here, we have tagged our lichen telli. we have our lichen thalai using ribbons and thumb pins for long-term monitoring and it will help us it had helped us to identify each lichen thalai with the time series intervals and we have used a transparent sheet for measure the thalus area so it was it was a quadrat divided into one centimeter squares and we have put the quadrat we have printed the quadrat on a transparent sheet and we put that sheet on the lichen thali and counted the cells which are covering by the thalus. So then we can get an idea about the thalus area and we have done these thalus area measurements in monthly intervals from April 2022 to March 2024. And also we have done the lichen transplant experiment. So we studied the like we started the lichen transplant experiment in January 2024 and we did it for three months. As Dr. Gautami mentioned you we did it in six sampling intervals and five locations. Now I'll to the second part of my presentation. This is about the support I got from the DILMA for my study. So it was started from the... No, I can't say that it was started from the start of my experiment. It was very far beyond that. So we started our experiment in 2021. So before that also the University of Peradine and Dilma has the relationship, but I got the support from the 2021 June. So I started my plot democation in 2021 June. So since then I continuously I receive support from the Dilma. So basically they hosted me, not only me, our whole team, they hosted us, they provided the food, accommodation and all our logistics and also they have allocated a team for our field work our project especially they have given us field assistance and security for our experimental plot and the equipment and also the tower protection. So I should mention a name here Mr. Vijay Sadekaran, he was working with like two and a half years now, three years now, so he was working and giving So he was giving us all the time, he was giving us full support for the project. And also Dilma has given us the field assistance and the labor when we needed. In these pictures you can see that when we need to take our equipment and gas cylinders and all our heavy material to the sampling plot Dilma has given us allocated the labour from the Winsbury estate and they have supported that very much. And also I should mention that we have a four hour tower, the meteorological tower, we need continuous power supply. So Dilma has provided, given us the CB power supply to our sampling plot on their cost. So I should mention that also. Then I'll move to the third part of my presentation. It's the achievement, current achievements. So we have identified, as Dr. Gottami mentioned, we have identified about 150 lichen species from the sampling plot and the surrounding area so it is very rich diverse area and also we have recorded very good lichen but significant lichen responses for the ammonia enhancement so you have seen these images earlier also so these are some responses we have monitored and we recorded from the away from our experiment to enhance ammonia concentrations. We can use these data, we can use these observations and records to calculate the ammonia concentrations and also identify the critical levels for ammonia, critical levels of ammonia for lichen species. It's because the responses of lichens for the ammonia concentrations are species specific and also they show a good response for the ammonia enhancement in enriched ammonia concentrations so this information will be helpful for further policymaking and further research Thank you.",Success,

The Dilmah Tea Company,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq49ofwyLuY," When he was just 20 years of age, my father devoted his life to tea. And what a beautiful devotion! It was formed around his desire for kindness to people and nature. It was 1950, a very different time. Economists believed that the social responsibility of business was to make profit. And so, Merrill J. Fernando was alone in his quest for a fairer, more ethical global tea trade. With faith and relentless determination, he pursued his desire to make the world a better tea. And 35 years later, he disrupted the colonial tea trade when he offered his Dilma Salon tea to the world. Dootraib It was the first genuinely ethical producer-owned tea. And it was picked, perfected and packed garden fresh, unblended in Sri Lanka, right where it was grown. Nearly 40 years since the debut of Dilma Tea, my father's promise of tea made with the assurance of great taste, natural goodness and ethical purpose is honored without compromise After 73 years of devotion to his cup of kindness my father laid down his tasting spoon and is now at rest Yet we feel his presence constantly in the values he embedded into our family business and our mission. My brother Malik and I are now joined by the first member of the third generation of our family, Amrit Meril J. Fernando, who carries his grandfather's name. Did I mention that my father coined the brand name Dilma from our names, Dilhan and Malik? Well, he did. And whenever I tell anyone, they say, wow, it must be cool. It is. But it also comes with phenomenal responsibility. Dilma is not an ordinary tea. Our brand is formed on a foundation of family values. That means authenticity, respecting the influence of nature in each tea, quality, freshness, and kindness. A minimum 15% of our pre-tax profits are used for the benefit of less fortunate people around the world. That kindness is at the heart of Dilma and it is our strength and joy that our mission in tea touches the lives of hundreds of thousands of children youth women and men in Sri Lanka and beyond We have the privilege of calling ourselves an ethical family business because the work our Meril J. Fernando Foundation does in building schools, hospitals, fighting cervical and childhood cancer, enabling aspiring entrepreneurs, addressing gender imbalance and inequality. Dilma Conservation fulfills the same commitment to nature, engaging in climate action, environmental education, promoting nature-based solutions and restoring degraded ecosystems. And we really love tea. What's not to love in a herb that was discovered 5000 years ago, crafted by nature with such elegance and a profusion of aromas, tastes, hues and flavours. Tea has been celebrated for millennia as a natural medicine. This is the heart of Sri Lanka's famous tea country, where we grow the world's finest tea. We hand our teas to make sure that we only pluck the tender shoots two leaves and a bud where flavor and plant antioxidant goodness are concentrated We are artisans and our love for fine tea is a key ingredient because tea making is demanding. It combines art, science and respect for nature. A tea maker must also respect tradition. We do that in the time-honored orthodox method we use to make our teas. We taste over 10,000 teas each week. Each different influenced by sunshine, wind, rainfall, soils and shade. That's the magnificence in tea that so richly inspires gastronomy and tea mixology. There is a tea for every mood and every occasion, for every food, beverage and song. Fine tea is extraordinary in its aroma, taste and goodness. And we promise you, our global family, that your every sip of Dilma tea will bring a smile to the faces of less fortunate people. As my father would say, do try it.",Success,
Leopard Conservationist chats with Dilmah Gen3 Amrit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-e3Bn6hmqo," The Landmark Foundation in South Africa has collared and monitored over 73 leopard in its region. And the question I want to ask you Dr. McManus is that how is the current situation in South Africa with leopard? Leopard conservation in South Africa is diverse. you've got protected areas but most of its habitat exists outside of protected areas and so there are lots of human leopard interactions and that's where we focus and there the situations range from the leopard density being quite high to extremely low and so our focus is making sure that these leopards across quite a vast region can connect to one another genetically i don't know if i'm pronouncing this right but the recolonized picketburg population has been one of the highest densities of a meta population is that right could you just explain what a meta population is and what you've just studied your recent study about the picket bird population sure so the landscape in south africa is quite fragmented and so uh the picket bird happens to be this mountain range and maybe you can explain to everyone what exactly the picket bird is okay so the picket bird is just a mountain uh that's ice and it's the general name of this area it actually got its name from conflicts back three four hundred years ago which is a picket a military picket that took place but back to present day it's extremely isolated useful leopard habitat but it's surrounded by completely modified environments and for a long period there weren't any leopards on this island of habitat until recently and so we were interested to understand, you know, not only were they present, but they had very high densities, which is astonishing. So we wanted to understand the drivers of what resulted in the recolonization. And there's these little strips of land corridors connecting them from other source populations. And so not only were they able to recolonize, but existing at very high densities. What happened and the fundamental drive is that there was a reduced conflict in the area. There was enormous amount of lethal control of carnivores for two, three hundred years in that region and so they were all but decimated. And what a meta population is, is that it's a fragmented populations of different leopards that might be disconnected from one another but the dispersing individuals are able to connect and so these land bridges and and corridors are fundamental for these populations that might locally go extinct to be able to recolonize. We covered a few areas there that how humans can play a role in protecting and growing these densities of leopard. Can you explain what a land corridor is and how it benefits the conservation of leopard? Sure, so typical conservation model is protected areas, which is fragmented. And often it's not highly effective to conserve biodiversity and especially these wide ranging mammals like leopards. And so because they exist mainly outside of protected areas, habitat connectivity is important. And what is leopard habitat might be different to what is elephant habitat, for example. So understanding what those differences are, are important to facilitate the species to be able to move. And why leopards are a good ecological indicator is that because of the high traffic level, they need to eat different prey to survive. And so automatically where they exist, those prey generally tend to thrive. And so that's what makes them a good indicator species. So land corridors we determined what benefits leopard dispersal and at the same time that automatically encourages wildlife dispersal Are there communal species Do they interact with each other quite often Leopards are typically solitary which is why they've been able to live outside of protected areas for so long. For example lions are very community driven and social but that means that they require a lot of space and a lot of food and so they've been restricted in South Africa to to protected areas and parcels of habitat. The leopard strategy as being a solitary cat is fascinating, but it's allowed it to find refuge in little patches of habitat. They do have a very social driven demographic or layout of the land. So what their neighbors are doing are very important. We've actually found that females play a crucial role in how the population is dispersed. So although they are solitary, there's a lot of social cues. Okay, that's interesting because if we look at, say they have three cubs, a mother has three cubs, how long would those cubs stay with that mother until they seem worthy of exploring the landscape themselves? Between 18 months and two years. And what's interesting, that seems to be the standard for leopards from the southernmost point of Africa all the way up to Sri Lanka and elsewhere. So interestingly, as a species, the conditions don't tend to change for you know with that but 18 to 24 months and then the males will tend to disperse and the females will remain close to the natal area and often the females will shift about to let their daughters move in next to them speaking about human cohabitation we have a beautiful density of leopard on our tea gardens in dunk hill can you please tell us what you've learned with your interactions with the farming communities, with the communities that are impacted by leopard. How do they perceive leopard, number one, and what have you educated and spread awareness on on how they can interact with wildlife, in particular leopard and human? That's a really good question and that really is the fundamental point of the conservation efforts and that's where it's going to be most effective. And it's a mixed bag. You get landowners that are intolerant of them, often because of just a lack of information, of understanding the species and fear. So the main bridge there is to provide information, share data, and evidence-based approach becomes key. So we found astonishing evidence that if one protects your asset in a production landscape, in our instance it's often livestock, if one protects livestock you will often have lower losses however the current status quo in South Africa is often trying to eradicate predators in order to reduce losses and that's not very effective it's also very expensive in instances so you know those are some of the messages that we that we've sent out and and interact with with the landowners but we also take them by the hand and take the journey together and one of the reasons we've been able to do the work we have is by doing it with the landowner so we've often learned together what does work and what doesn't work but the one fundamental is that you need willingness you need to have somebody that is going to be open to new ideas and so the other spectrum is from intolerance is the step towards tolerance coexistence and that that bridge is just understanding. I think when we look at elephants, for example, in Sri Lanka, we look at it in a holistic approach We look at how it benefits our ecosystems as ecosystem engineers but also how it can bring an ecotourism sort of approach In the context of Africa, I think it's valued at 1.6 million per elephant throughout their whole lifespan. Is there any way of capturing that sense for leopard how it can be holistic in its benefit to humans and to nature. Yes. And of course, there are these fantastic ways to try and get a monetary value on the payment for ecosystem services, you know, the benefit that these animals have in a role. And I'm not aware of studies that have done that in the South African context. It's a fantastic way to measure. But what we can do and say is that we've done a lot of economic modelling on working with nature rather than against nature. And often if you use a lot of technical tools, it can be quite expensive to work with nature. So taking that step back and looking at practical ways that are easy to implement, economically viable, effective for the desired outcome, having good or low impact negative effects on the environment and socially acceptable tools. These things are often a win-win for everybody. You'll tend to have lower losses on production landscapes if you implement these sort of deterrents and therefore have a far more valuable product at the end of the day. So it does come back to a monetary evaluation and it can be expensive to conserve but it can also be extremely expensive to work against nature. I think it's what my father just said before he left was that the importance of impact rather than process right to make it practical and approachable. Exactly, so and having an evidence-based approach is quite key especially if you want to get that message across and encourage change. Let's get back into leopard habitats actually. Habitat degradation, how our human expansion of our human footprint is continuously expanding and putting pressure on wildlife and in particular leopard populations. I was reading a study you did on translocation and how leopard move from different locations and how that can impact their mortality, how they interact with the environment. Can you explain a little bit about that? So the connectivity is sort of the end goal. That's if you could wave your magic wand, what would the world look like? And so in the Sri Lankan context, for example, if you have a look at the distribution of protected areas, what would be the link between those that then wildlife can sort of do its own thing and manage itself and we can work within and around those areas. And that's sort of the fundamental objective of the long view. I mean, that's the dream, right? That's the dream. That's what everybody wants to push. Yeah. And the good news is that it's definitely achievable, especially with the good work that WNPS is doing and the local Sri Lankan or the government in Sri Lanka and the wildlife biodiversity programs, it's impressive. And the one thing that's really notable to me as an outsider coming in, is one of the biggest assets in Sri Lanka, I think, is the tolerance, the attitude towards wildlife that people have, and that's really encouraging. Something a bit more personal and closer to home is, how were you inspired and how are you so passionate about what you do and why leopard, why wildlife? I been exposed to nature since an early age I grew up on production landscapes and so I was lucky enough to understand there a balance within that environment The scary bit is that in my 20 years as being a conservationist I've seen the loss of species take place, the loss of the frequent visibility of species. If you drive from one point to the next, you don't have any more insects on the windscreen anymore compared to 15 years ago. So these are quite astonishing. And we've also got alien invasive plants, which then homogenize an area, consume a lot more water, exclude a lot of biodiversity. And so there's a very tangible visual change to the landscape. And so the benefit to that is finding solutions that are then easy to implement and practical. And they certainly are feasible. So the good news is that although there's quite cataclysmic problems ahead in terms of biodiversity loss, there are solutions that are highly effective. And if implemented, nature wants to thrive. And with a little leg up, it'll revert back. But restoration ecology becomes fundamental in that. In terms of everyone who's listening in right now, how could they get involved and help you scale up this impact and restore our ecosystems? Well, this is the question and I guess the information is quite key. So podcasts like this will go a long way. And then finding an interest, going out, exploring nature, finding your connection within that, understanding it will really go a long way. You know, if you might be sitting in the middle of Colombo, a big density of people. How can you help? You can find products on the shelves at your local market where you can select how they are producing their produce. And if there's a sustainability approach, but a real sustainability approach like Del Matisse, and that's why it's interesting to take your model. But, you know, other industries need to start employing these things. But that I would say is probably the low-lying fruit. Let's get the economy involved and anybody can then partake in driving a positive conservation change and responsible land use change. Then, of course, there's environmental outreach. There's finding out from your local NGOs and government departments of wildlife conservation. Having a look at their websites, finding out about the projects. There's so much going on and so there's certainly something going on in your area that you can find out more about. I was talking to my friend last week telling him that I was going to meet you. And we did a quick search up on the internet and realised how many animals, species are going to go extinct, they say, in this generation. And what I want to say is that we value individuals like yourself that continue to push businesses, economies, communities to do the right thing. because it's not easy to convince certain stakeholders on what your mission is and and why you're doing it because they're all stuck in one mindset and it's wonderful to meet people like you who break the barriers and break the mindset to do the right thing. That's a huge endorsement and compliment, thank you. And I'd like to say likewise, you know, Dalma is an inspiration. You know, seeing a big corporate company taking on the leadership role and encouraging the change, not just at the top you know but within the whole value chain all the way down to the bottom and that's the that's the the key to change and that's the solution well it's my grandfather's philosophy uh whatever we uh take from the land is our duty to give it back and look after it so amazing i really resonate with that thank you so much for coming and thank you for joining us thank you",Success,"The Landmark Foundation in South Africa has collared and monitored over 73 leopards.

An appeal to the global tea industry by Dilhan C. Fernando,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqo3OVQhehg," Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, welcome back. What an awesome start. I told our two co-chairs that they missed their vocation in life. Stand-up is definitely their opportunity. Now, this morning we talked a lot about opportunity. Now it's time for a sobering reality. So forgive me, I don't mean to cause you indigestion. The solution is in the antioxidant in a cup of tea. There are some beautiful teas outside, so please indulge. And let me talk about value in tea. Now, since tea was first discovered, Camellia sinensis has been revered for its value as a medicine, as a beverage, as the taste of nature from Lao Tzu's proclamation of tea as the elixir of life to the current perfect alignment of fine tea with Gen Zers, with millennials, and their desire for the flavor exploration that we heard this morning, the natural wellness we heard of, the authenticity that drives quality. There is no herb that so perfectly matches evolving lifestyle preferences than tea. How then can this most valuable herb, more relevant to humanity today than ever before, suffer the paradox of an existential crisis? And it does. Following its genesis in China, tea grew as a by-product, unfortunately, of a vicious and exploitative enterprise that we know as colonialism. But by the 1960s, that catastrophic phase and its ancillaries, including the quite brutal East India Company, had ended. Yet, this extractive form of capitalism persists, albeit in the hands of different actors. Now, central to this contradiction is the mistaken assumption that price and value are equal. They're not. Price is arbitrary. Value is fundamental. Price is a market-driven construct. It's imposed by supply and demand. It's marketing, information, misinformation. It's wholly disconnected from the notion of value. And value, value is the sum of the livelihoods, the welfare of workers, the soils, the food security, the safety, health, wellness of our customers. It's a socioeconomic development of our nation. It's also the basis for genuinely fair and ethical trade. So, capitalism superseded colonialism, and businesses, many foreign entities, global corporations, now in the role of determining the economic prospects of the independent producer nations. There is an interesting and contentious Canadian law professor, Joel Bacan, who wrote in his book The Corporation, published in 2004. He talks of the problem with capitalism and he says, we have a global theology without morality, without a Bible. And he warns that dangerous And his words not mine forgive me for the minor diversion into French And she says we are not going to be able to exist in a global context if we are the bastards of our business Now, that's one perspective. And go back a little bit further. In The Wealth of Nations, the foundation of economic theory, Adam Smith in 1776, he talks of individual enterprise delivering general benefit. And because he acknowledged that no society could flourish, where the majority of people lived in poverty. Individual enterprise delivering general societal benefit. It has to filter down. Now, since the falsehood that was perpetrated in the GFC, the global financial crisis in 2008, that tea should be sold on everyday low price, that has been the overriding trend in tea, unfortunately. Producers struggling for survival in a category that boasts the second most popular beverage in the world, EDLP and its highly profitable proponents assuming the role and function of colonists. When prices are low, I don't need to tell you, quality is hard, challenging even for the most passionate amongst our producers. Innovation nearly impossible. In 2003, the former CEO of Boeing instructed his team to cut costs. He told them to develop a plane for less than 40% of what the 777 had cost to develop. He wanted it built for less than 60% of the 777. The result was the 737 MAX, an aircraft whose sensors malfunctioned due to poor design and caused the death of 346 people. Now, cost cutting in tea may not deliver such a catastrophic cost in human life, but it does. does. The progressively low quality, the massive compromise in the benefits for producers that fuels half price, that fuels Black Friday, that fuels buy one, get one free offers, promoted by a facade of value, images of lush tea gardens, the promise of great taste and goodness of ethics, sustainability, that corrosive discounting carries offshore margins that are the stuff of dreams for producers and it's clear therefore that in all of this it's the producer that pays the price. The consequences are evident today. Rapidly diminishing shelf space, a lack of innovation, a lack of everything that we heard about this morning in the tea category simply because the money isn't there. Compression of specialty and mainstream tea into tea, a commodity. An absence of the richness of terroir, a feature of tea that is the strength of the flourishing wine, coffee, chocolate, olive oil categories, and even water, as Shabnam reminded us. We see an increasingly undifferentiated offering that is less tea, more herb, and the subjugation of sophistication, of diversity, of quality, and the potential in tea. All of this subjected to commoditization. And so tea is an affordable luxury. We know that, we saw that this morning. It has a rich heritage and it has a richer relevance to modern lifestyle. In that reality, discounts really, I hope you'll agree with me, at the end of this conference, it's the last refuge of the most unimaginative. Worse deep discounts the genesis of a cancer that spreads eventually consuming its host That bad news But now there's good stuff too. We're blessed with a herb that was born as a medicine. It evolved into a beverage. It has potent benefits for human health, from cognitive to cardiovascular health. but it alleviates stress and more in an unassuming herb that delivers diversity as complex as nature herself. There is ample evidence of all this. You don't need to take my word for it. PubMed, 22,000 at last view, research papers evidencing this scientifically. And so there is also ample evidence in that complexity in the 10,000 to 12,000 teas that we are blessed to experience each week in our island. The magic in that richness of diversity of teas from Dimbulla, from Uwe, Sabarga, Moura, Kandy and more. The sophistication is in the dramatic difference that sunshine, rainfall, winds and soil have in transforming each continually. The definition of luxury today, remember, it's changed. It's no more material. It's now far less material as it was many years ago. It's now defined by nature. because for the first time we are at risk of losing nature. It's delivered more consciously, ethically. And so tea is so very luxurious, influenced by nature, and so very valuable. So consumers are concerned about health and wellness more than ever before, from baby boomers to Generation Z, sensitized, I guess, in a sense, by the pandemic. They love taste adventure. They value nature. They love natural experiences. Tea is abundant in each of these. natural diversity, plant-based taste and goodness, promoting healthy aging, dignifying food in a very special way through its emulsifying aspect. And so, when we talk of some of the priorities that were discussed in the morning, tea, the goodness in tea, promotes healthy aging. It adds excitement to the no-low beverage trend that we are seeing around the world that are devastating beverage revenues? Tea has the answer. Enhancing mood, immunity, complementing lifestyle in a way that no other beverage can. And the consumer is on our side. Between 60 and 80% of consumers, depending which study you look at, are estimated to value sustainability, a similar number value ethics and the lives of less fortunate, and for the first time, they're prepared to pay a fair price for what they consume. We are demonstrating on the streets of Europe and the USA for that right. Now, as growers, we're on the front lines of climate action, inequality, gender, and most of the SDGs. The decisions we make can determine whether future generations have the same food security, ecosystem services, the welfare that we all are privileged to have in 2024. We want to do what is right. But the right and valuable part costs more than the one that price demands of us. Fair wages, access to education, productive soils, great tasting tea, a sustainable, resilient, and reliable industry are the responsibility of consumers retailers brands traders and producers equally For the global tea industry to survive we need to rebuild the foundations of our great industry to discard extractive colonial principles. We need to adopt a new deal, and that must involve consumers, retailers, brands, traders and producers in a collaborative effort to focus on quality, on worker welfare, climate action, innovation and sustainability. all of the things that consumers value. Now, my father, tea maker Merrill J. Fernando, envisaged business as a matter of human service. His lower middle class rural parents could not afford him an education beyond what was known at that time as a senior school certificate. That lack of an MBA was his greatest blessing because his most significant influence on his business philosophy was his mother. And she taught him that our humanity, kindness, always takes precedence over every action and interaction, business or personal. The strength and resilience of our tea business today is that philosophy. It's a philosophy of kindness. When I went to university, I wasn't taught that that is a principle of business. And it is that which endures consumers, endears consumers. It's that that benefits workers and brings us their commitment. It's that that helps us in times of challenge. It's that that connects us to the wider community, supports innovation, supports development as we strive to fulfill my father's promise of making the world a better team. Now, the change that is necessary is complicated, and it won't be easy, but nothing great ever is. What is beyond doubt though is that it is urgent and it must be done. And together we can do it for the sake of our industry, its people, its future. It begins with the right mindset, acknowledging the preeminence of value over price. It continues with the commitment to rebuild a sustainable tea industry around what the consumer is telling us as explained this morning, and on a foundation of taste, of wellness, welfare, climate resilience for a more equitable and vibrant industry. Only that, only that can deliver value through a diverse, delicious, healthy and flourishing tea category. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. We have an incredible panel today. We have Dr. Ibrahim Afsha. We have Dr. Mao Limin. And we have Kun Sinienat and Nathaniel. And they are going to share in their respective areas, talking about different aspects of value from different perspectives.

Tributes from family and friends: Merrill J. Fernando,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMg7l2mdMDY," Music I said to Meryl, I think you need to promote your own tea. And of course Meryl was very sort of taken aback by this. And this was going to be the first time that Meryl would say to camera, do try it. Do try it. And it was this that really caught on, that captured the imagination of customers when we put it on television. So Merrill said, I'm going to come back in nine months, and if this commercial is not working, I'm going to find somebody else. So when Merrill came back, you know, the 18 to 19-year-old guys, and they saw Merrill, and they wound down the windows of their car, and they stuck their heads out and said, do try it, do try it. They all mimicked how Meryl was saying do try it and I knew Meryl was on the way and his famous Dormar brand was on the way as well. I was 29 and he was 59 when we first started this partnership and he's helped me a long way in that journey In 95 I got paralysed and Meryl was a great influence on me in getting me up and going again And so every New Zealander knew him And it was very sad on his death because honestly five million New Zealanders grieved that day, because they all knew him. They all knew him. And they all thought, what a nice man he is, just from the television screen. He was a visionary. He saw things way ahead of the time. I'm so happy that we're now able to pass that baton on to his sons, Dilham and Malik, and to his grandchildren, because I know they are worthy of their father's legacy, and they will do a fantastic job. One of the things that resonates really strongly across our customer base is the absolute love and appreciation that our customers have for Dilma, the family, and particularly Merrill, and has brought about a brand that stands for much more than commercial returns. So the values of taste, goodness, purpose resonate with our customers and of course our consumers, which is why Dilma is the number one brand in New Zealand and has been for the last 18 years. Gentle person, very relaxed as well. So he got on with everyone, he knew everyone, he never had a bad word to say about anyone. He was just a very, very nice, genuine person, and we formed a really strong relationship and a good bond which lasted many years Myself and my wife both really enjoyed getting to know him One of the great things I liked about Merrill in the 33 years that I knew him was his ability to have fun Not something that he was always seen as. In Sri Lanka he was always seen as the chairman and most often serious. So that was a great trait that Merrill had. Fun, enjoyment and actually caring for others. I used to be the All Black coach and Meryl and the Dilhan and the family invited us over. We had a marvellous time. Went to the tea plantations, coached the tea plantation kids rugby, went to the elephant orphanage. I had an elephant named after me called Ted, now it's been released into the wilds. Also went to some schools where Dilma were supporting kids who had learning difficulties and just got to know the Dilma family, which was fantastic. Some very special memories of Meryl and the family. I used to produce the Foodtown brand of tea, and I was told I needed to either change my job or lose my job. And Meryl said to me, this is your opportunity in life, but only if you take it. People have to be part of their own recovery People have to be involved in their own recovery Meryl you changed my life Thank you so much Meryl would travel to New Zealand two or three times a year going into supermarkets. Meryl would sit and stand in the tea aisle and watch consumers shop. They'd walk along, they'd pick a certain tea. He would then talk to them accordingly, ask them why they were picking that particular brand. And he would find out things about his own brand from consumers, just having a chat, leisurely in the supermarket aisle itself. Fantastic way to be able to understand a brand and to market his brand accordingly. That's how he put together a lot of those plans. I really got to spend some time with him and immediately he becomes like your second dad. His dedication to people is just incredible. What he does for people, how he thinks about people, is something that I aspire to. you",Success,

To give you little samples, so we started in the tea fields in the mountains. We had the Elephant Orphanage. We went to Cape Wellagama where you had the cliffs meeting the Indian Ocean. Spectacular views. Yesterday was more about the heart at the MJF Foundation. Some amazing stories we shared. We took a ride on tuk-tuks and I'm here to tell the story. But here is our week on the road. and what a week it's been live from Sri Lanka. We've got beautiful tea country, we've got beaches, we got leopard we got elephant do try it We all know this We join in Big round of applause ladies and gentlemen That is sensational Low in terms of spice medium hot I feel the Aussies Hall.

I kind of feel sad, but it's been so amazing. It has been. Thank you, Sherbo. I'm glad that that's come across because we have been blown away. We didn't really know too much of what to expect coming here to Sri Lanka, but my goodness, there's so many different ways to enjoy this country. Let's say good morning to our friends here. Nice and early. Hello! Great to see you all. We're now joined by Dilhan again. We had you on at the start of the week. CEO of Dilma. Thank you for taking us around your country. We're going to look at some of the pictures, but tell us, have we done Sri Lanka justice this week? You have. You've been to the cheese fields, still on cinnamon, you've fried our food. You even went in a Toktoknam. That was brave. Oh, yeah. We're going to talk about that in a moment. I'm still having flashbacks to that. I'm still processing what happened yesterday. But this is a beautiful country. I feel like Australians are now starting to know there's so many different things. Surf is very popular here in Sri Lanka. Really intense waves. You've got whale watching out here, Cape Wellagama, where we stay at the cliffs, meeting the Indian Ocean. What else would you say to Aussies thinking about taking the step and just booking it, saying, you know what, I've never thought of it, but Sri Lanka this week has convinced me I'm going to do it. Sri Lanka is about the people. So whether it's a tuk-tuk driver or whether it's a chef making you a really hot curry or a great hopper, it's about the people. And I think that's what you experience here. You've got the jungles, you've got leopard, you've got elephant, you've got all of that. But it's the people that bring it together. And we love Aussies. Oh, good. It's mutual. It's mutual, except when we're playing cricket, it's mutual, generally. It's all right, we don't mind losing occasionally, but not too often, all right? We'll have more in a moment. Sunrise is brought to you by Dilma Tea home of the world finest ethical salon tea Do try it You touched on it briefly there I got to ask you as a man you know born and bred here in Sri Lanka what's going on with the tuk-tuks? I mean, I loved it, but I was also so terrified, and people who watched on our show were like, is that legal? Like, what is happening? You know, even the tuk-tuk drivers don't know what's going on. I got that vibe. You know, vehicles get from A to B. Yes. and whatever it takes, yeah? Shortest possible distance, right? I asked the driver, Titsara, who was awesome. I said, what's the speed limit? And he said, 40, but we do 60. Yeah, as fast as you can go. Yeah. No seatbelts either. No, what are those? No rules, no seatbelts. But somehow it works. How does it work? Well, you know, we manage. Sri Lankans, we are flexible. So you go here, the cars come this way, you horn a little bit, just to say you're there. Yeah. So you experienced it. But, you know, we eat curry. Yeah. we drink great tea and we have cinnamon yeah so we are different we're really totally a type apart you're living a beautiful life over here thank you for sharing your wonderful country with us round of applause for dhulhan joining us today and you might have noticed at the start of the week team you can go back and watch the text i was saying welcome to sri lanka but now i've been here a week i say sri lanka is that right is that the correct pronunciation sri lanka exactly i feel I feel like I'm a local now. Sri Lanka. I've been converted. Is it Sri Lanka or Sri Lanka? Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka. Lanka. Okay, not good to do over a link. Still, thank you.

Sam Mack is in his final day in Sri Lanka. What an adventure, a journey it's been for you. Absolutely loved it, Sherva. I hope you guys have enjoyed it too. I'm sure it's encouraged many Aussies to put Sri Lanka onto their list for travelling for bucket list adventures in the future. To be honest, I feel like I'm just smiling because I'm still alive after that tuk-tuk adventure yesterday. I feel like since then I haven't stopped smiling. It was pretty wild out there, but it's all part of immersing yourselves in the way that it works here in Colombo. Let's say good morning. Ayubawan, everybody. Ayubawan. What a wonderful crowd again to bring things home. Let me tell you where we are this morning. So we are in Colombo, which is the capital, and we're at a place called 8 Degrees Birra Lake. So we're on the water on a floating barge. So this is right in the heart of Colombo, which is a city of around 2 million people. The population of Sri Lanka, around 22 million people. Very exciting to show you the sights. We've got a big morning to wrap things up for a Friday. Sunrise is brought to you by Dilma Tea, home of the world's finest ethical salon tea. Do try it. A huge thank you to the team from Dilma who have taken us around and been such an amazing host group to show us this beautiful country.

We are big thanks to Dilma for taking us around this beautiful country and now let's have a look at a special performance from the Praveenie Dance Academy. It's a traditional dance unique to this particular region where we are. The Udawalawa National Park is where we're based for this morning's show. Lots of colour, lots of energy, lots of character everywhere you visit in Sri Lanka. Thank you so much, that was wonderful. We really appreciate you guys performing for us this morning. As I mentioned earlier in the show, we are at the Elephant Transit Home. We want to share with you a little bit about what they do. So here it is. Check it out. Malika, tell us what you do here at Elephant Transit Home. We are collecting orphaned elephants from all around the country and we rehabilitate them and release them back to the wild. What types of wounds or injuries do the elephants arrive and need your help? Road traffic accidents, snares, gunshot. So they arrive here, what's the next step? Final step is release them back to the wild. How many elephants have you re-released into the wild? Since 1998 we have released 171 elephants. Wow. Having flashbacks to Bec breastfeeding Margo. Actually that's a really bad comparison, I probably shouldn't put that. Can we cut that bit out? She might see it. That's the sound she'll make when she sees it. Okay, it's getting worse. That is a metaphor that will come back to haunt me guys. But a big shout out to the team here at Elephant Transit Home. Wonderful work that they're doing. As we mentioned, over 170 elephants re-release into the wild. And that is their goal. These elephants are orphaned or injured and they do amazing work. So a big thank you to the team for having us. We've got a lot more still to come live from Sri Lanka. And what about the hospitality there? They are laying it on thick for you. You must feel so welcome. Yeah. Thank you, Sam. Being spoiled.

Round of applause for Nat, nailing the pronunciation, very impressed. It's a great spot here, it's a national park attached to it. We had a five or six hour drive yesterday from the mountains where we were for day one which was absolutely stunning, the tea plantations but today we're talking about the elephants Dr. Sumit joins us tell us about what you guys do here at the elephant transit home what happens here well this is a very inspiring program the Department of Wildlife Conservation decided that any baby elephant born in the wild should be rewilded not taken into captivity so they set up this facility to take abandoned baby elephants due to injury and other reasons and rehabilitate them till they are of age that they can be released back into the wild. Incredible. A number of those elephants are orphans, so they literally have no other option. So that's why humans get involved to help them. They might only be three months old, some of these baby elephants. We were talking about it yesterday and then working towards that goal of being released into the wild as a herd. Is that correct? Yes. We organize them into a group and release them because elephants are very sociable animals They like to be in groups so we have released about 171 elephants so far into the wild and there are 16 documented calves born to elephants released from this center so this is this is i would say arguably the best uh rewilding program for elephants in the world you should be very very proud of it we're going to talk more about your love for elephants in a moment let's do your weather Brisbane rain 17 degrees, Sydney showers 17, Canberra morning frost partly cloudy 12 degrees, Melbourne mostly sunny 13, Hobart partly cloudy 12 degrees, Adelaide partly cloudy and 14, Perth showers easing and 19, Darwin sunny and 33. Briefly before we go why elephants why do you love these animals so much? Oh it has been a passion from my childhood and I decided at the age of 55 I quit whatever job I'm doing and devote my life to studying elephants and of their behaviour. And it's so interesting because they're such intelligent, sensitive animals and people have complex lives. So I am now working with elephants trying to understand their lives. Well, thank you so much for all that you do. Big round of applause for Dr. Sumit, everybody joining us here this morning. We are here at the Uta Wallowa National Park.

'Teamakers' advice on tea & happiness,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBTEaQ35lGs," As tea makers, we are puzzled. How can Britain, a country that consumes so much tea, be considered the second most miserable in the world? Could it be that they are mixing their tea? You have something there, son, because mixing never does any good for tea. And why I connect drinking tea and happiness is simply because tea contains L-theanine. Of course, it's got antioxidants in abundance, but L-theanine enhances cognitive ability. It aids clarity of thought and it makes you feel better. It puts you in a good mood, Britain. And Sri Lanka, well, we just came out of our crisis last year. And we are, I think, the second least miserable. One of the happiest countries in the world. We haven't got a lot to be happy about right now, but we have a beautiful nation and we have beautiful tea. So we are happy. L-theanine again but what else son? Maybe it's that they're adding milk. Okay now I think my son is on to something. Adding milk, I know you love milk but it doesn't do the tea any favors either. So keep your tea pure, garden fresh, unblended and that's what we believe in here at Dilma. But a little milk if you must, a little honey, keep it natural and keep it pure. Enjoy the antioxidants and the L-theanine and I guarantee Britain will be seeing you as the world's happiest country next year. And here's to a happy Great Britain.",Success,"Britain, a high‑tea‑consumption nation, is reported as the world’s second‑most miserable country, while Sri Lanka, emerging from a crisis in the previous year, ranks among the least miserable and is described as one of the world’s happiest nations. The speakers attribute tea’s mood‑enhancing effects to its L‑theanine content and abundant antioxidants, noting that L‑theanine supports cognitive clarity and a positive mood. They argue that adding milk to tea diminishes these benefits, recommending tea be consumed pure or with minimal milk or honey. The brand Dilma promotes unblended, garden‑fresh tea and suggests that such consumption could improve Britain’s happiness ranking by the following year."

Introducing Dilmah Finest Ceylon Cinnamon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN6-I5WQQC0," The adventurer Marco Polo described Sri Lanka as the Isle of Spices. From Sri Lanka, the resplendent island, comes Ceylon cinnamon. No spice was considered equal to Ceylon cinnamon. King Solomon came to Sri Lanka in search of cinnamon trading with the city of Gaul, then known as Tarshish in 1000 BC. Prized for its fragrance, taste and wellness, for over 4 millennia, Ceylon cinnamon was an indispensable part of royal ceremonies in ancient Egypt. Grown and crafted in the same time-honoured manner for millennia, true cinnamon only comes from Sri Lanka. In the first century AD, 350 grams of Ceylon cinnamon cost 5 kilograms of pure silver. Like many great rulers and products, Ceylon cinnamon has a pretender, cassia which masquerades as cinnamon. Only true Ceylon cinnamon grown and perfected in Sri Lanka offers the sophistication and goodness that has been so precious throughout history. The cinnamon bark can only be processed by expert artisans. It starts by harvesting branches from the cluster of cinnamon that is done expertly by by hand using a shaped knife the harvested cinnamon must be kept moist and then scraped and rubbed before peeling and finally quilling The process is demanding, requiring time, expertise and experience. With each step being more intricate than the last, it takes years of experience and days of effort. True cinnamon is scientifically proven to be endemic to Sri Lanka. We grow Ceylon cinnamon, working with rural artisans to select and produce only the finest continental grade and powdered Ceylon cinnamon. As we do in our mission with Ceylon's finest tea, we care for our cinnamon from nursery to quill and we make sure that we work with our people and nature for kindness and sustainability. Produce that is grown with the love of an artisan and perfected with kindness to people and nature offers taste that goes beyond sensory, embodying kindness that is life-changing alongside the aroma, flavor and good health.

Dilmah Tea Joins Fight to End Cervical Cancer in Sri Lanka,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dQIP4uqbrw," From amongst over 8.8 million Sri Lankans at risk of cervical cancer, over 1,500 are diagnosed each year and for over 50% of them it's usually too late. Now that doesn't need to be the reality. And I'm delighted to be here in Colombo this evening to witness the signing of a historic memorandum of understanding between the MJF Charitable Foundation and the government of Sri Lanka that Rotary is an integral part of. Proud Movement, Dilma Foundation and the government of Sri Lanka combined together with Rotary to ensure that cervical cancer is either detected early or in fact prevented. We are thrilled that this project will address the issue of cervical cancer that affects and takes the lives of 700 women each year at present in this country. And to do that you need to vaccinate children in the age group 9 to 12 or so and be able to screen the older women who may already have contacted the disease Today, the new journey started to strengthen the CA Cervix screening program. So I'm sure this will help to save lives. Every business has an obligation to the purpose beyond profit, to serve their community. And so we must embrace this collective duty to ensure the wellness of women, to address inequality and poverty alleviation in every possible way. And that's our promise to the women and girls of Sri Lanka, that we, together with Rotary and the government of Sri Lanka, will work towards the eradication of cervical cancer by 2030.

We emerged from COVID expecting to build back better and yet our world is more fractured today than ever before and this is where my father's philosophy comes into focus. His vision was of family business, founded on family values, serving humanity with kindness to people and nature. And today, the impact that delivers is for us more fulfilling than anything else. On the principle that we are stronger together, we will continue to build the coalitions for environmental and social good, working with stakeholders in the tea industry, universities and academia around the world, our government, Biodiversity Sri Lanka, and the global compact network in Sri Lanka, we will intensify our efforts at using those collaborations to deliver benefit for the greater good at a national level. And next year will be no different, except that as we work towards growing our sales and our revenue with Dilma Tea, we are also working at doubling the impact, the social and environmental impact of Dilma T because the two cannot be separated. I didn't intend for this message to be as long as this but the context is important because at the end of this year a year that has been full of challenges a year in which we lost our founder my father I want to thank you because it is our customers whose faith in my father helped him to make his dream a reality. And his dream was for kindness, to offer tea with the assurance of great taste, natural goodness and ethical purpose. And 2024 will continue to be a year of kindness for us. Because for us, the impact of what we do is what strengthens our team. And the more we look around our world, the more we see the need for businesses and people to come together to collaborate and deliver change for the better where the environment and where the lives of people are concerned. In helping my father to make his dream come true, you fostered a new economic model, one that understands the importance and the interrelationship, the revocable interrelationship of natural, social and only finally commercial capital. Dilma as a brand will only grow as its impact grows, always maintaining its integrity and never compromising.

Honoring Merrill J. Fernando: A Tribute by Colombo Tea Traders' Association,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRdrEXshb-0," A mighty oak has fallen, but from its corns many more mighty oaks will grow. Today is a special day. We will discuss the historical aspect of it later. But let us first remember Mr. Meryl Fernando, a visionary entrepreneur and a great champion of Ceylon Tea. His profound impact on the tea world, his humanitarian efforts were recognised by international organisations and will be remembered and celebrated. Together today we acknowledge, learn from and strive to emulate his achievements. So let us commence by rising and observing a moment's silence in his memory. It's great to see leadership of the past, leadership of the future here in the room. And it's an important aspect of the CTTA. It is important that once again we understand the context in which Mr. Fernando achieved all of this and gave so much to the trade and our country at large. had a ringside seat of the progress, the ups and downs. Many of us see the great buildings, the bands on the shelves and forget the roots and how these were built one, one teabagging machine at a time, one structure at a time, building people, building brands. Many of us think that if we are lucky we come up with a pretty designed and it's going to be seen and recognized by the world. So all of us, at least speaking for myself, are students of the case study of the life of Mr. Merrill Fernando. It's a privilege indeed to be here and speak a few words at this commemorative sitting on behalf of a doyen of the Sri Lankan tea industry. I had a glimpse of, not glimpse, I read a couple of chapters of the book that he wrote just before he passed away. realized that he has joined the trade in 1950, even before I was born. And over the years, but within a short time in fact, he wanted to do something totally different from the run of things in the tea industry of Sri Lanka. He wanted to do from here what the colonial masters were doing with our product, which is going from here as a raw material. So Meryl saw things differently and went on to do what he did. And here we have in certain airlines, in many hotels around the world, many supermarkets around the world, which of course is a daunting task I can see, because he was always on PO Ceylon T. Sri Lanka was losing the Australian market, just to quote one example. And the reason being, with the nationalization that took place about two years before I joined the trade, brought in a, as Ensler would always agree with me, brought in a whole load of disaster for the industry. But by 89, 90, 92, we came back on the Australian shelves and that was through Dilma, for which from the point of the Sri Lankan tea industry and on our personal behalf of Sri Lanka Tea Board we are greatly indebted to this gentleman for what he did for Ceylon Tea Once when I met him had a discussion he told me, Niraj, when I go to a market, I go and look at the shelf and I see what is on eye level, which is where the best of the teas, the highest priced teas are stored on the shelves and I see X brand and Y brand and whatever and they are at let's say for example $5.49. I am pure Ceylon tea so therefore I will come there at $5.99 because I want to make the difference and that stuck in my mind of what he did. I raised my head to this gentleman for what he did for us during his lifetime. And I used to come to Mr. Fernando asking him to pack the tea bags for me. He always, very graciously, I used to go to him, he used to always sometimes stop his orders and pack my orders for me when it was urgent. So I will now read the citation on behalf of Chairman CTTA. As a tribute to late Desha Mane and Merrill J. Fernando, We, the Colombo Tea Traders Association, present this citation to celebrate the remarkable life and indelible contributions he has made as a true visionary and luminary in the realm of tea. His legacy is one that resonates across time and borders, a testament to his unwavering commitment to excellence, innovation and passion for tea. The journey of this legendary personality was one of fervent dedication and pioneering spirit etched into the annals of Ceylon's history. As the founder of Dilmati, an identity that brings pride to Sri Lanka, he redefined the industry landscape, transcending convention and bringing a refreshing force of authenticity to global tea culture. He championed the principles of ethical tea production and marketing, ensuring that every leaf bore not just a mark of excellence but also a story of integrity and compassion. He was immensely responsible for the growth of the value-added tea industry in Sri Lanka, as his success inspired others to follow in his footsteps. Mr. Fernando's yielding commitment to quality, combined with innovative marketing, propelled Dilma and Ceylon tea to unprecedented heights, elevating it to a name and standard admired and relished across continents. His inspiring efforts to nurture sustainability and empowered local communities epitomizes his boundless empathy, transforming the lives of countless individuals across the nation. His commitment to conservation and responsibility of cultivating standards as a testament of his foresight and sense of responsibility towards our planet. The vision of Mr. Fernando extends beyond the tea fields, touching hearts and leaving an indelible mark through his philanthropic endeavors. His commitment to education, health care, and social welfare eliminated parts of hope for those less privileged, bringing a brighter future for generations to come. We, the members of the Colombo Tea Traders Association, reflecting upon his remarkable life, stand indebted to Mr. Merrill J. Fernando for his unassailable dedication to Ceylon Tea. He will remain a beacon of inspiration for all who tread the path of excellence in marketing and in the service to humanity. In hallowed pages of history, Deshamani and Merrill J Fernando name shall forever remain unintertwined with the rolling green hills of Sri Lanka and their aromatic breezes and the cherished flavour of Ceylon tea Let us, with profound respect and gratitude, salute the life and work of this exemplary man whose contributions have enriched the lives of so many immeasurably. us rejoice in remembering his legacy so that generations to come will continue to be inspired by his dedication to Ceylon T and his commitment to serve humanity. MR. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of my brother, our families, my colleagues, we are incredibly humbled by the Felicitation that the CTTA has extended to my father and also thank the chairman of the T-Board for his kind words. You know, every great industry is formed on the commitment and the passion of great people. Mr. Abbas Akbarali, my father, so many others who are represented by those present here and who have been in this room. For my father, his was truly a devotion, a lifetime devoted to tea. And for many of you, I think you also experienced, as did Anil, sometimes Neeraj and others, the strength and the ferocity of my father's belief in Ceylon tea. but many misunderstood that as a form of belligerence. It was to an extent because for my father there was nothing beyond quality. There was no compromise that was possible. But the assurance I have for you is that with that same belligerence, he took Ceylon T. to the world. I have stood by him, traveled with him for 20 years, initially carrying his bags, thereafter taking down notes, but always being with him amongst buyers. when he always explained, I have the finest tea in the world. It must be offered at the right value. And exactly as Niraj shared, he would always look at the competition and say, look, I'm not competing with the number one. I'm not trying to be the biggest. I want to be the best because I believe, I believe in Ceylon tea. And it is that which has given us the strength. It is that which gave us the ability to enter the Australian market with confidence, which my father did. And I must apologize, Neeraj, we had a correction. Our records were incorrect. It wasn't 1988. It was, in fact, September 1985 that Dilma entered the Australian market. And the same for New Zealand. But it is that that has given us the foundation and the courage to be able to take Dilma beyond to unconventional markets. Yes, a mighty oak has fallen. And yes, the oak is going to be perpetuated in philosophy and it is going to be emulated. And the reason for that is that the values that my father ingrained without compromise into my brother and I will, without question, continue through our generations. And I can tell you whether it concerns Ceylon tourism or Sri Lanka tourism or Ceylon tea, the standard that my father established is one that cannot be compromised because he formed such a firm foundation in our business. He formed in the foundation, in the MJF Foundation, he formed an irrevocable commitment to kindness to people, to nature. You see that manifest a couple of weeks ago in our invitation to join us in our journey in sustainability You see that in the hundreds of millions that every year are spent on the health welfare benefit on supporting entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka and more in the area of the environment. But ultimately what we should celebrate today is a great Sri Lankan who who stood for Sri Lanka, who understood the value of Sri Lanka, and who fearlessly championed that value. He did it with a level of confidence. Whether it was confronting media in the UK, which is almost barren where it concerns Ceylon Tea, whether it concerns the US, again a similar situation, he did it with absolute conviction that Ceylon Tea is the finest on earth. Now I know we have our internal differences and our internal concerns, and Neeraj set those out much better than I could. And I think the best way to honor that memory, not only of my father, but also the other great men who formed the foundation of our great Ceylon tea industry, is to make a commitment to reforming that foundation that Neeraj mentioned is today weak and needs support. I think as Dr. Daya, as Daya Vikramatunga often reminds us, some of the basics are what contribute to the quality and are what are necessary today, even as we look to the future of our industry. but also we must remember that rebuilding that foundation is what will sustain the livelihoods of millions. And in the future, I have often tried to contemplate what could life be without Ceylon tea. It's quite difficult to comprehend. However much we say that the brand of Ceylon tea is eroded, yes it is. There is a new generation that doesn't recognize Ceylon tea. It is. But every facet of the history, the heritage, the livelihoods involved and the authenticity, the variety in Ceylon tea are perfectly aligned with the preferences and what a new generation of beverage consumer tells us, whether it is a millennial or a gen Zer. We work a lot with consumers directly and I can assure you that if we were to undertake some of those corrective actions that Neeraj shared, there is a consumer who will not only accept but embrace because our industry has an unparalleled heritage. It has an unparalleled offer in terms of the taste, the diversity, the wellness. And it has a very intricate interrelationship with the livelihoods of people. And today, conscious consumption is something that is an overriding concern in every area, in every grocery category. It is conscious, authentic, ethical, sustainable product that is winning. And it's no longer the big brands. It is the small brands that represent these with sincerity. So in conclusion, I want to thank each of you, and I want to thank the CTTA for honoring our father and Amrit's grandfather in this way. And I think that remembering that this great industry has as part of its foundation the commitment, the love, the efforts, and in my father's case, the faith of several formidable individuals, I think the best thing that we can do to honour or possibly take that citation into action is to work towards rebuilding our industry and remembering also that united we will stand, but divided we will fall.",Success,"Merrill J. Fernando entered the Sri Lankan tea trade in 1950 and founded the Dilmati (Dilma) brand, pioneering value‑added tea marketing that placed Ceylon tea on airline, hotel"
2023 Christmas Wish from the Dilmah Family,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpF3yItMvHk," Christmas is a very special time for our family. It's not Christmas as usual this year though, because in 2023 we lost my father who ignited our family passion for tea. We celebrate his legacy at Christmas because Christmas is a time of kindness and my father's love for tea was equaled only by his desire for kindness. In that kindness which he embedded at the heart of our family business, he lives on in everything we do. He is here in our MDF Centre in Morutua, our largest and most vibrant centre invested in bringing positive change to people's lives. Every month thousands visit to learn about nature and find peace in this unique place. His kindness touches every member of our team, from the Tea Gardens to our factory, through through scholarships for the children of our workers, the integrity and respect we extend to each, and the entrepreneurship programs we offer them once that time is done with Dilma. My grandfather is here amongst the rainbow children guiding our MJF Kids program celebrating the ability of children with Down syndrome cerebral palsy and autism while giving wings to the dreams of youth and children from less fortunate communities. Our grandfather's Dilma stories echoed hundreds of times each year in the lives of each of dreams come true.

The greatest lesson ever learnt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlLIabpqxSQ," Hi everyone, I'm here in Adelaide with my father and I wanted to ask him a few questions on how he did it when he was beside my grandfather and what he learned on his trips because you've done this for many many years. Can you give me some advice on what you learned when you were with Sia going to retailers, going to hospitality events. Tell me what you learned. Since the 1990s son I've been traveling with him. I can tell you the one thing that I learned from him, not because he said it, but because he did it. He said it and he did it. And that's always more valuable than someone preaching to you and not practicing. So I learned from Sia's practice, the fact that you can never compromise. And you know, he had this invincible faith. He knew that if he did what is right, even though he lost money or lost opportunity in the short term, he knew that he would always come good. So he used to always tell me, don't chase the Prophet. Don't chase the opportunity. Do what is right and the opportunity, the Prophet will follow you. And I can tell you that that is probably the single most important piece of advice that Sia has given us, both Mahapai or uncle and I in the sense that it has given us direction to know that you always have short issues You might have the pandemic you might have the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, but you never forget the fact that your mission is quality, integrity. You know, during the pandemic, there was a moment when we had a terrible threat of our business model crumbling simply because we couldn't get the supplies, we couldn't sell our product, the supply chain was broken. But yet, whenever I asked him, he would always tell me, build the hospitals, look after our people, no matter what. Russians, looking after the families, continuing to expand the work of the foundation. At a time when there was very little revenue coming in. not easy but the wisdom of it is only evident in retrospect. So yes, incredible wisdom that came from your grandfather, biblical and something that he practiced. you",Success,"In Adelaide, the speaker recounts lessons learned from his grandfather Sia, with whom he has traveled since the 1990s. Sia emphasized never compromising on quality and integrity, advising that doing what is right will attract opportunities rather than chasing short‑term profit. During the COVID‑19 pandemic and Sri Lanka’s economic crisis, Sia directed the business to maintain supply chains, build hospitals, and support families while continuing foundation work despite minimal revenue. These principles guided the speaker and his uncle Mahapai in their operations."

Spreading awareness on nitrogen pollution,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SuhJb2Aq-M," South Asia has emerged as a major hotspot for nitrogen pollution and there's not a lot of policy in place to tackle that. So the first step for that is to provide scientific evidence on the basis of which policy can be formed. As a part of that, here in Sri Lanka, we have set up an experiment where we are measuring the metrological conditions at very high spatial and temporal resolution in a tropical forest, which in itself is an understudied ecosystem. The second part of our work here is the ammonia enhancement experiment, where we increase ammonia concentrations in a controlled plot, and then we study the effect on different organisms within this plot. So that has given us, it is giving us new insights on how this gas can be harmful and what its impacts can be. So far we have collected about more than one and a half year of full metrological data, which is one of the most complete data sets from this region. And the ammonia impacts, they take time to show up, so it takes about more than five years. But we done about three surveys now and we have at least three time points where we are trying to see the change in the vegetation conditions after the impact of ammonia So in tropical forests or in general forest ecosystems in South Asia are quite understudied And we don't have a lot of baseline information of what goes on inside these forests, the physical and chemical processes that occur within these ecosystems. And so using this experiment, we're providing some very baseline data and the first evidence of what these forests do and how they impact the greater environment. For future, I think this experiment will work as a platform on which other institutes can build on using this as an example because it is showing how critical this data collection is. And then even using our methodology, they can replicate the experiment elsewhere and broaden the impact of the work that we're doing. This site is also, it's a good replicate of a lot of other disturbed ecosystems across South Asia. So the results that we collect here can quite easily be applied elsewhere as well to the greater region So I think that been one of our greatest biggest achievements So we came to Sri Lanka mainly because Sri Lanka in itself is an ecologically very diverse country and there's a lot of biodiversity here which needs to be protected and conserved. This area especially around Rila Gala Forest again has a very very high species diversity which is important for the ecological balance of an ecosystem. So far we have collected about more than one and a half year of full metrological data which is one of the most complete data sets from this region and the ammonia impacts they take time to show up so that it takes about more than five years but we've done about three surveys now and we have at least three time points where we are seeing trying to see the change in the vegetation conditions as after the impact of ammonia. So we came to Sri Lanka mainly because Sri Lanka in itself is an ecologically very diverse country and there's a lot of biodiversity here which needs to be protected and conserved. This area especially around Rila Gala Forest again has a very very high species diversity which is important for the ecological balance of an ecosystem Since 2014 there was already a lot of work being done here and there had been new discoveries of lichen species and already existing large number of lichen species so that was a perfect platform for us to set up this experiment. The impacts of a given event are very far reaching and they are not regional so for example the effects of a certain event can be felt across the borders, across the continents, into other parts of the world. Also along the policy lines, countries are now trying to meet their targets according to the UN regulations and all the international conventions. Whereas some countries are better equipped to achieve their targets, other countries are not. More developed countries have better environmental monitoring capabilities which the underdeveloped and developing world is still trying to build up on. So to expedite this process and to have a more fair and equitable climate action, it is important that there is a transfer of not just knowledge but expertise on scientific measurements, monitoring, modeling across the world from where the expertise is in two parts of the world where that expertise is badly needed.",Success,"South Asia is a major hotspot for nitrogen pollution, prompting a Sri Lankan experiment that records high‑resolution meteorological conditions in a tropical forest and conducts controlled ammonia‑enhancement plots to assess impacts on vegetation and organisms. Over 1.5 years of meteorological data—one of the most complete regional datasets—have been collected, and three vegetation surveys spanning roughly five years provide the first time‑series evidence of ammonia effects. The Rila Gala Forest site, noted for high species diversity and prior lichen discoveries since 2014, serves as a replicable baseline for other disturbed ecosystems across South Asia. Findings aim to inform policy under UN environmental conventions and facilitate transfer of monitoring expertise to developing countries."

Fine tea making and fine wine making are so very similar. We've been in Australia since 1985 and Australia has such a rich tea drinking tradition so it is incredibly important because Australia also loves and produces incredible wines. With the synergies and the parallels between the two it is incredibly important for us to come and share that so that there may be a greater appreciation of tea that Australians will understand how closely tea and wine and the agricultural aspects of that the terwa and the beauty of the two Understanding today what parallels exist how soils influence the character the intensity how we taste and how taste is affected by sunshine, morning sunshine, afternoon rains and so on. That's the first step. So in our collaboration with Professor Sue Bastion and the University of Adelaide, we'll be looking more into that. there's going to be a very rich partnership there. I'm very excited about working with Dilma. This is a very new relationship. I have been working in tea for a few years, and I've begun to understand how complex it is. I thought wine was the most complex, but no, tea is definitely very complex as well, and such an intriguing product. I think there's a number of things that we can do. There's obviously shared learnings. So what are the flavors and characteristics of tea and wine? and then impart that enthusiasm onto the consumers.",Success,"The speaker is traveling to the Barossa region of Australia, noting a 15 °C temperature at the end of winter.

For me it's also been a personal loss. All the articles on Merrill referred to the tea industry. Dilman what he had done. He made a similar contribution to the tourism. Our tourist industry, our hotels would not have been the same without it. I remember the beginning, it was when I was Prime Minister in 2002.

That was the time Adrian Zega had come he was about to start Amangall and looking at Amangalla and he was talking about tourism how we could expand tourism and there was a Geoffrey Dobbs who came along talking of boutique hotels. And this concept of boutique hotels came on, talking about how we could turn the planters' bungalows into boutique hotels. But before we… and Merrill used to follow it, though he was not in the industry. And then I lost the election, I didn't think we could see boutique hotels again. And one day Mary came around and said, look, I am starting tea trails. And he invited me to one of the first boutique hotels. And he established such a standard that we can all be proud of him. Later on, he went to Cape Valligama and set another standard. So you have to remember him not merely, but not only for the contribution he made to tea, but also the contribution he has made to tourism.

School of Tea: Tea Inspired Breakfast with Chef Peter Kuruvita & Dilmah Mixologist Alberto Pizzaro,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj4EfoIRasA," Music The first official day of the School of Tea and we started with a breakfast. And it was so much fun again to put tea into food. Music Today we woke up the students with two cocktails. This one was mocktail, using rose and ginger tea, beetroot juice, puree and carrot juice. And the other one was a spice chai, using Ceylon spice chai. I started thinking about new ways to make life easier for chefs and hotels and restaurants. And that is by trying to use a little bit more elixirs. The elixirs have so much potential, so much power and so much flavour that cooking with them mixology with them is so much easier so we'll talk more about that but today I think the other innovation this time was teaching the chefs to blend every single tea just a little bit of it and to use that as a garnish so that the first thing that attacks your sensory system when you put food to your mouth is your nose and if there's a tiny sprinkle of tea on top of every dish obviously the relevant tea by the time it goes into your mouth your brain already thinks that there's tea in it. So innovation never stops and that's what I love about doing what I do for Dilmati.",Success,"The School of Tea held its first official day, beginning with a breakfast that incorporated tea into the food.

Tea Inspired Mixology with Alberto Pizarro,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okcM3y9CN7U," My guest is Alberto Pizarro, all the way from Madrid. Alberto is an incredible mixologist, an expert in gin, and now also inspired by tea. Alberto, fantastic to have you on the show and to have a tea-inspired chat. Yeah, I'm more than happy to be here. How have you enjoyed Sri Lanka so far? It's my second time in Sri Lanka. I'm not having much time this, in this occasion because I'm doing a lot of tea cocktails and mocktails for our guests, which I'm very happy to. But years ago when I came here, I discovered an amazing land full of nature, elephants, animals, all sorts of spicy food that I love. So that was really my best time. So I still have a little bit of time to enjoy this time. And tea? and tea. So tell me. Lots of tea. I like that. I like that. So tell me, in the world of mixology, we hear that tea cocktails are trending. What are the big trends? Is it low ABV drinks? Is it non-alcoholic? What's happening? Well, now you want to get a successful bar, not specifically talking about cocktail, but talking about bars. Bars need to be a place where photos could be taken. Like Instagram is a powerful tool. Before we had tools like shakes and everything, that was good for our work. Now a powerful tool is the social media. Social media is very important. Nobody is going to post a bad looking photo of a photo of a bad looking cocktail. So you need to impress them at first sight. Then taste will come. And the taste now it's more and more important because people are used to try different foods, different beverage, so people have more culture about ingredients. The library of flavors and smells is bigger and bigger, so you need to impress them with new flavors, orange juice, pineapple juice, and maybe a little bit so common nowadays. You need to impress them with different ingredients, different teas, different infusions, different fruits, different spices, different everything. And it's a good question about the classic cocktails because if you go back centuries back the first cocktail you know contained tea. Tea was a substitute for many other ingredients because it gave the texture but it gave the content also was a more or less cheap ingredient if you compare it with expensive wines or liquor. So it was a way, a very convenient way of giving flavor to drinks. We won't say cocktails at this time, but drinks, punch, for instance. Punch is the classical drink full of tea And okay all this disappeared in the 90s where cocktails were about grenadine blue curacao all these ingredients But then around 2010 a little bit earlier a group of mixed lodges, especially from cities like London or New York, went straight to have a look at what the special teas could find and include it in the recipes. And from there, we have this trend of using tea mixology. So we are here at the Grand Hotel in the heart of Sri Lanka's hill country. Here is the place where you have beautiful golden brews, light, bright, quite sparkling and energetic teas and you've got at the other extreme down by the ocean, by the Indian Ocean, you have the intensity of our low country teas. So with all of this you You talked about texture and flavour. With all of this, do you find that tea has the versatility that you need to cater to this new generation of cocktail drinker? Sure, because teas, not only teas, but also teas, for me, each tea has a different story telling. And the first thing that I do when I have to think about the recipe is look at the tea, infusion in this case, blood orange and eucalyptus. This tells me different story than almond infused elopico. That's different in my mind. This is maybe takes me to winter and this take me to the Italian coast. So I can start working with Prosecco, with Aperol, with an Italian spirit. And I still haven't even tried the tea, but the story tells me the ingredients. Here I will go for more robust, for more oak barrel, let's go for a rack, let's go for whiskey, just because it's almond, just because it's a spice, it's different than a fruit. So each tea inspires me in a different way, that's why it's so versatile. We're not just talking now about green tea or black tea, but even with different textures and different flavors, you have different ways of using this tea. have strong very strong breakfast tea you're not going to mix it with vodka you need to keep the strength of the tea with a very intense spirit that's going to my mind you can do the opposite you can break the rules also but my first thought always is about the what's on the label what's the name what's where it came from what is infused with and then i start tasting and then maybe my my mind changes and I go in a different direction. But this is my starting point when I think about tea. Tell me a little bit about your technique, because you can cold infuse tea, you can brew it strong, you can brew it into an essence. What do you like All this but also you need to try different techniques Like today I got a new idea Why not infuse Okay, you're going to taste that in a few hours. Why not infuse egg white? And then you shake an egg white in a cocktail. But it's not tasting and smelling like egg white, but it's smelling like lamb and suciong. Egg white, for instance. Why don't you have a very strong, over-proof rum, and instead of reducing with water, you reduce it with green tea, for instance. So there is always new techniques that you can explore, apart from the obvious ones, infusing a spirit, making a cold brew, making a hot brew, using it in a chai. There are many, many different ways of using them, but you always can create new ones. having ideas from kitchen, having ideas from scratch. So in terms of using tea in different ways in a drink, of course you can use it in the liquor itself, but also perhaps as a form and rimming. Any other things that you can suggest that we can think of in our mixology, tea mixology? You should try, try, try and try. You should try and of course we have some obvious combination that we know as well, as well, orange and cinnamon for instance, that's very common coming from the kitchen world. But why not try new things? Why not try different combinations every day? It's like when you have an open bottle of cherry wine in your fridge that you know it is going to last like between one and three months and you open it for having a meal with the specific food pairing that everybody knows, like dry sherry wine with jamon ham but day after you still have the bottle and you order a pizza why not try it if this works as well day after you will make a pasta try it as well so try try try one is the obvious you know this is gonna work this is boring world without risk is boring so you need to take the risk to order a barbacoa pizza with a dry sherry probably it's not gonna one in the Livio, but who knows. So here we have the beautiful golden teas we talked of, light, bright, little oaky. What kind of drinks would you suggest that we use for this kind of no radia tea? Let's go for something that is complex but light at the same time. Let's go for a single malt instead of a smoky whisky, for instance. Let's use some hints of vanilla, butterscotch, all these subtle caramel flavors that are strong enough to pair with the tea, but at the same time won take over the tea so we keep balance But how This is a good question Maybe in a syrup so you enrich the tea you make it more dense more intense in the cocktail because sugar will push the flavors And little ingredients, sugar, the syrup, the tea syrup, the single malt, little bit of bitters, not a lot of ingredients in this case. Maybe top up with some sparkling wine just to make it even more elegant. So if you look at the opposite, the intensity and the bitter chocolate notes, the earthiness in our low country teas, how would you work with that? Is there a principle that we should follow as we explore? My question is, which sort of spirit is this drinker waiting for? Probably not an strawberry. The person who used to drink this tea probably into mezcal for instance, into a Jamaican over-proof rum. So if someone who really likes taking this sort of risk in flavor, it's time for chocolate bitters for instance. It's time for, why not, a fermented something, a fermented piece of fruit that you make a juice under control. Obviously we work with the fermented drinks and foods like that. Tepache, fermented pineapple, very common in Mexico. Let's go for this sort of ingredients. I'm sure that the people who drink strong tea are ready for a strong spirit. And on the other side, maybe not, but also yes, why not? At the end, a dry martini drinker, it's subtle in flavor, but it's strong in a spirit. So why not? Try, try, try offering and then you will see the guest face at first. So you will say if it doesn't work, we change, no problem. But following some common sense rule, 90% of the times it works. Tell us some of the classics that you think could go well with good tea. One of my favorite classics is Gimlet. I use green tea, green tea with jasmine, all these sort of teas that we know very well with gin. I make a syrup with it, not very rich syrup, let's say two parts of the tea, one part of sugar. And in order to balance it, because it's not going to be more ingredients, a little bit of citric acid instead of lemon juice that also will give some lemon flavour. It's treated and it's quite a flavor-forward drink, just two ingredients at the end. Fantastic. Alberto, I'll stick to tea. You have your infusion. Cheers, my friend. Cheers. Thank you.",Success,"Alberto Pizarro, a Madrid‑based mixologist known for gin work, is currently developing tea‑based cocktails and mocktails during his second visit to Sri Lanka, where he highlights the country’s hill‑country “golden” teas and low‑country “intense” teas. He notes that tea mixology, which fell out of favor in the 1990s, re‑emerged around 2010 in cities such as London and New York, driven by a broader trend toward low‑ABV and non‑alcoholic drinks and by the need for Instagram‑ready bar aesthetics. Pizarro emphasizes tea’s versatility, using techniques like cold infusion, spirit reduction with tea, egg‑white emulsions, and tea‑based syrups to match specific flavor narratives and to pair light teas with single‑malts or robust teas with mezcal, over‑proof rum, or chocolate bitters. A signature example he cites is a gin Gimlet made with jasmine green‑tea syrup (two"

75th Edition of the Dilmah School of Tea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbvf8Xs7pUU," Welcome to the 75th session of the Dilma School of Tea. Since 2008 we've been exploring the magic behind Camellia sinensis. We're talking about tea, about the natural plant-based antioxidant goodness, apicalocatechin gallate and a lot more.

But experiencing this in real life and real time is nothing compared to what I had in mind. It really is inspiring. We had the opportunity to visit to see the foundation of Meryl Fernando, how he's taking care of the kids and the women. It's really inspiring and giving me hope that there is actually a lot of kind people around. Just coming over to Sri Lanka and seeing the whole journey from crop at the plantations through production and all the way to cup and the experience that you get. Premiumize your experience, whether it be with food, whether it be with a cocktail, whether it be with cheese, whether it just be on its own.

Pour A Better Tea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7NFvNyIaEg," What makes a tea better? Some say it's all about the classic taste. Others believe in grand production ideals. But what if we told you there's more to it? So much more to it. That a tea is made better when it is plucked by people who are paid better, treated better, and supported better. That a tea is made better when ethics are stirred and poured into every single serving. When business serves humanity through kindness to people and nature. When inspiration and education lay in every corner. When factories work for our planet and not against. When everyone is empowered to beat their potential. When equality and inclusivity go without question. And when every cup, sip and taste delivers on a dream that tea can make our whole world better. better. This was why Meryl J. Fernando dreamt of a better tea. This is why his family continues this dream today. And this is why you don't have to dream of a tea that can change the lives of a hundred thousand or so people.

World Cerebral Palsy Day 2022,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brraWzYUpco," As a parent, there's nothing more precious in the world than your child. From the day they come into this world, all you want is the best for them. This World Cerebral Palsy Day, we want to remind you of how important early detection can be for your child. With the help of our early detection through our disability app, parents and children both benefit. Parents are able to seek the right medical advice they need. Children are treated right from the start to minimize long-term effects and for better outcomes. Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to rewire, relearn, and strengthen important connections. This is most important in children aged 0 to 6 years. And the first two years of our lives is when our brain has its highest neuroplasticity. That means during this time, the brain can attempt to create new parts around an injury by allowing the healthy areas of the brain to take over. This is why early detection is the key to successfully intervening to support children and their families so the developmental issues can be tackled before they become ingrained problems. We developed this disability screening app so that the families, education and healthcare professionals around children with disabilities are able to support their development, inclusion and active participation. As we create a more accessible future for everyone, we encourage you to embrace diversity, support and celebrate those living with cerebral palsy. I'm Amrit Fernando and I thank you today for helping us with every cup of tea to fulfil my grandfather's philosophy for serving humanity with kindness.",Success,"World Cerebral Palsy Day highlights the importance of early detection of developmental issues in children aged 0‑6, particularly during the first two years when neuroplasticity is highest.

Zero Emissions Day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP1RmPuTvWo," They say the flutter of a butterfly's wings in China can cause a hurricane in the Caribbean. Similarly, the little actions that we do, maybe traveling, maybe grocery shopping, or day-to-day habits that we do, can have a greater impact when you consider it collectively on the planet and on the natural environment. And we know that most of our atmosphere, about 78% of it is made up of nitrogen. They again say too much of anything can make you sick. Is this the same for nitrogen? To find answers for that we have Dr. Nettie Van Dyck with us today. She's from UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. And Dr. Nettie, welcome to our podcast. And I would like to ask many of us have heard or seen about carbon footprint. right and most of us are educated in so many ways because there's a growing climate emergency that is circled around the carbon footprint. Similarly I would like to know whether there's something called the nitrogen footprint if so whether it is how adverse the impact of nitrogen footprint have towards our planet if you can explain it a bit. Thank you very much for having me. Yes Yes, indeed, most of us have heard about the carbon footprint. The nitrogen footprint is far less known. There is not really a reason for that because nitrogen, as you already said, is everywhere. It's in the air, it's in the soil, it's in our food, it's everywhere. And most of it is stable and doesn't react. But a small proportion of it does react. if we have too much of it, then we get problems. Nowadays it's getting towards too much of the part of nitrogen that I called ammonia or nitrate and it becoming more and more important that we should reduce this kind of particles in the air in the soil in the water because it has a big effect All plants need some nitrogen for growing. Otherwise nothing is growing. There is no rice, there are no vegetables, there are no trees. But, what you already said, too much can be, more can be too much. And we are studying that kind of things, how much you need and how to avoid waste. And that's the important thing about the nitrogen footprint, to see what we can do, where we are wasting nitrogen and what we can do to reduce it. It's great that you study about those things because you gave me a perfect prelude for my next question. I would like to ask then again, because we are familiar with what are the sources that we, how we contribute to the carbon emissions or carbon footprint. Similarly, I would like to ask domestically or in an industrial scale, how do we contribute or what are the ways or the sources that we contribute to nitrogen footprint? Yes, that's a really interesting question and also really important. and as I said earlier nitrogen is everywhere so a certain amount of nitrogen is common and we need it everyone needs it and the common sources are almost also from everywhere it can be from traffic from burning but the major sources are in the fertilizer production in animal housing that kind of thing so chicken sheds, pig sheds, they are emitting quite a lot of, in this case, ammonia. Okay right So that means most of the poultry and fertilizer related activities that we do especially a country like Sri Lanka, who has I think more than 70% of the population indirectly or directly engaged in some aspect of agriculture, whether it's animal husbandry or whether it's or any other agricultural production. So that all is a source point to increase the nitrogen footprint, it seems. Yes indeed, but of course we need some nitrogen to grow the vegetables and to grow the rice and to breed the chicken. So in case of a balance, they need the nitrogen, but we should prevent to waste too much fertilizer. Yes, exactly. So we should use it in a clever way so that we don't waste anything or that it don't leach to the water and that still the plants get enough to grow and to feed us. Right. I'm learning so much already. So that actually makes me to ask the final question from you in this podcast. Can you give us some tips, maybe industrial scale or maybe in a household level that you said that we need to use the fertilize in a balanced way. Maybe some tips, how do we identify this balanced way or in poultry or animal husbandry, how we can manage it in a way that process optimization or any other way that we can contribute to control the nitrogen growing growth of nitrogen footprint. There are already quite a few simple things you can do. For farmers for example if they are used in the field where they grow it, also they need to be careful how much manure or fertilizer they are using. can look at the field in different ways They can see if the plants have not enough nitrogen the leaves are getting yellow so then they need some food so to say But if they get too much the leaves are getting darker green and they can also get susceptible to fungi, more insects, so they need to find a balance. What they can do is they can take a soil sample and let it analyze and then that company can tell them how much they need to apply without wasting anything. So that's a good thing to do. Another thing is like the same as for carbon footprint, the travel. If you try to reduce your travel that will help quite a lot. one of the most important sources of the nitrogen emission are the poultry farms and the pig farms. So if we can reduce the amount of meat we eat, even if we are just saying, okay, I eat no meat one day a week, if we all do that, then that helps already a lot in the number of animals that are needed for feeding us, and in that way reducing the emissions of nitrogen. So there are quite simple ways to start with and then there are more difficult ways. But if everyone does their bit, that already helps a lot. Thanks Nettie. I think I should thank you for giving some smart and practical, simple things that you can do. Maybe changing a habit or two that you're already practicing. So, once again, thank you so much on behalf of Dilma Conservation and Dilma Tea that coming to Sri Lanka and doing this research with so many other collaborative parties. And we hope to see you here again in Sri Lanka very soon. Thank you. It was a pleasure for me. Thank you very much.",Success,"The nitrogen footprint, though less publicized than the carbon footprint, refers to the environmental impact of reactive nitrogen compounds (primarily ammonia and nitrate) that arise from fertilizer production, animal housing (e.g., poultry and pig farms), traffic emissions, and other agricultural activities; excess nitrogen can leach into soil and water, harm ecosystems, and increase greenhouse‑gas effects. In Sri Lanka, where over 70 % of the population is directly or indirectly involved in agriculture, the main contributors to the nitrogen footprint are fertilizer use and livestock operations, while the atmosphere remains about 78 % nitrogen overall. Dr. Nettie Van Dyck of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology recommends soil‑sample analysis to apply the precise amount of fertilizer or manure needed, monitoring plant leaf coloration to avoid over‑ or under‑application, and reducing meat consumption and travel to lower nitrogen emissions. The discussion was hosted by representatives of Dilma Conservation and Dilma Tea, who noted the collaborative research taking place in Sri Lanka."

Meryl Fernando founded Dilma Tea over 30 years ago when the tea industry was known to exploit local farmers and workers. Yeah, determined to see Sri Lanka take back control of its produce. Dilma became the first brand to sell from the farmer directly to the market and has been a leader in ethical business ever since. Nowadays, Meryl has handed over the reins to his two sons. We have Dilma CEO, Dylan Fernando, and he joins us along with his son, Amrit. It's great to see you. Thank you so much for joining us, gents. Thrilled to be here. Thank you. You've got a couple of coffee lovers here on the couch. You've got your work cut out for you two. Is it true, first off, can you tell us, that you and your brother Malik are actually the inspiration behind the name? Well, Dilhan and Malik. Of course. Makes sense. Ah, beautiful. Makes sense. Too smart. Now, you've brought a few of your tools in today to show us how to make the perfect tea. Are we going to get into that? Absolutely, because we did a survey to understand Aussie tea drinking habits. We found some crazy stuff. Like what? 72% of Australians don't brew their tea enough. That is one to three minutes. But the thing about tea, what we do is we grow it, we handpick it to make sure that there's goodness. There goodness in there which is why Bo you should be drinking more tea So when you say brew as in leaving the tea in for what To soak Three minutes is the premium time That it because you got to extract all that goodness Well, you know, we've got leaf tea here. So what we did was we brewed it off the set. So important thing is once you pour in the water, you've got to make sure you use filtered water. You've got to make sure that the tea comes into contact with the water. So if it's a tea bag, exactly what you said, you've got to jiggle it, but give it three minutes. But keep, I stir. And if it's loose leaf tea, you can stir. And then make sure that you get the right colour. So that's a good colour, unless you want tea really strong, in which you give it an extra minute. So if you're taking tea with milk, a little, maybe a minute or two extra. But brew it right, please, because that's how you get the taste and the goodness. Do you add milk to your tea? Never. Oh! Why not? Why not? Why? No, you know, tea, it's got incredible diversity. It's got terroir. We taste 10,000 different teas each week. And that is incredible because in Norelia, you have light, bright teas, and then you have a region called Ratnapura, which is at sea level, stronger, more intense because of the sunshine, because of the humidity. So all of those variations, they're beautiful. You might have a Ratnapura tea with a steak. You might have our extra strength with different types of barbecue. Did you just say you have tea with steak? Well, yeah, because... Wow! You love your barbecues So when you barbecue you have that caramelization on your meat or your chicken and the intensity and the earthy character in our teas from the low elevation pick up on that So you have the tea that dignifies the flavours, brings out the flavours, enhances the texture, but then helps you with the digestion. And that's why I'm telling you, please drink tea. Let's touch on something a bit closer to home. You guys are proudly from Schellenckart. Now, over the last few years, we've seen what's happened over there. There's been a coup, COVID, floods. What's it been like living through that experience? Because from here, it looks like it's a perfect storm over there. Well, you know, it started in 2019 with the Easter bombings. It went through a pandemic. So we had exactly, as I said, a perfect storm. Not a coup, but we had a protest that led to a change in regime. And now, thank God, we've got stability. And we are beginning to put down the building blocks. We are open for business. I was thrilled to see this week that the EU is beginning to encourage their people to come to Sri Lanka. And that's what we need because we need to rebuild our economy. Sri Lanka is beautiful, mate. Jeez, it's a beautiful place. Oh, mate. Something in the ocean. You don't realise how beautiful the ocean is there. And the food. And the food, the people. People. Thank you. Can we taste your tea? I feel like you're so cool and calm and we're all jittery from all the coffee we've had. Yeah, I've had about 19 shots of coffee already. So this could send me over. Well you know tea it immune boosting and its natural health benefits are one of the reasons you should have it Taste is the other Is it true that green tea actually has a higher concentration of caffeine than say a black coffee? No, they have similar levels of caffeine. Okay. Now, I hope you don't take your tea. Oh, no, you said you're a coffee drinker, so, yeah. What's this one? What is this one? This is our Dilma Premium. It's a pure origin tea. My father made that commitment in 1950. And you know, it was 37 years ago, literally a couple of kilometres from here that Dilma was born, which is why we love coming to Australia. See, I only like tea that's from Long Island, but let's have a look. Ah, there you go, see. I've got a few issues found out. I'm front, but then she'll come through. That is actually, it's like a hug in a cup, isn't it? That is good. And Rik, this is delicious. Are you a big tea drinker too? You know, there's a special way of tasting tea. Yeah. It's like this. Oh! My wife's going to love that. Is that a good person? Don't do that in public. No, I wouldn't recommend that, but give it a good note. Oh, no. Do you have to put your pinky up as well? Yeah. And the reason is you taste on your tongue, but you also taste on your brain. So when you do that, you aerate your olfactory bulb and you're tasting twice. You get the texture. You get it much. So that's what we do as tea tasters. And my son, third generation, has just joined the business. So he's showing off his knowledge. How beautiful. Well, thank you so much for coming. I'm actually really kind. Yeah, that's really calmed me down, hasn't it? Yeah. Ruined the show. Thank you so much for coming in, gents. Come and see us any time. Thrilled to have been on. Well done.

"Delicately, intricately: Craighead Single Leaf White Tea",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JrNrIDltZ4," This is the first time a baimu done, which is a Chinese method of making white tea. It's the first time this has ever been done in Sri Lanka and we did this on on Craighead Estate. This is the bud and the first leaf only, which is difficult to pick because you know, when you pick the tea it's not just simply picking in the conventional sense. You have pinch the base because if you don't you begin the fermentation so you break the cell walls and you begin the fermentation even before it should so then you get bitterness and you get coarseness and you lose all the delicacy in the in the tea this is made from the original seedling teas that were planted 140 years ago so it's it's it's called the it's called the china jat and that is how we get this kind of leaf appearance. So typically we have two types, the China Jock which was planted by the pioneers, which is one of these, and you get the typical Sri Lankan which is the Assamica, the variant that was found in the jungles of Assam. Now that is much larger because of the agro-climatic characteristics, the humidity and so on. Whereas the Chinese is smaller and it gives more sweetness and so you've got the floral and the aromatics here. I love it. I do. I love it. It's very smooth, very nice. Beautiful flavour. And again, it's delicate but in a different way. It's cleaner and it's lighter, a little softer. It's delicious.",Success,"The baimu method, a Chinese technique for producing white tea from bud and first leaf, was applied for the first time in Sri Lanka on Craighead Estate. Harvesting requires pinching the leaf base to prevent premature cell‑wall rupture and fermentation, which would cause bitterness and loss of delicacy. The tea originates from seedling plants introduced 140 years ago, known locally as “China Jat,” and is one of two varieties cultivated: the smaller, sweeter China Jock planted by early pioneers, and the larger Sri Lankan Assamica variant derived from Assam jungle stock. The China Jock yields a lighter, floral‑aromatic white tea distinct from the more robust Assamica type."
Lingering finish: Longjing Tea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3vX3DC96wE," This is the first one. The green tea, it's a Lungjing. It's from Hangzhou province. It's a single region tea and it is made in a very traditional way. It has a spear-shaped appearance so it is not the typical process that we discussed this morning but it is handmade. It's not rolled, it's made into strips and it has a, because it is not fired or not rolled in the conventional way, it has a sweetness, a softness which maintains also the herbaceousness and the vegetable characters in a package that gives a beautiful finish at the end. And so we chose it because we felt that as premiumization happens in tea and hospitality that we need to be able to present to guests teas of higher quality. So you can see here, some call it a duck tongue, some call it a spear shape, but it's made into strips. And that's done similar to the Japanese sencha, but it's a very different note. It a beautiful oceanic nose Yeah it spectacular And it got an oily texture it should have so um but you know very oceanic right yeah yeah yeah i want to make oh yeah yeah straight away Salad, citrus, yeah. It smells like nori, outside of the sushi. So it's a nice tea, it's quite unusual, but more than my introduction I'm interested to know what you think. It smells also like a round flavour. It's herbaceous, but it ends with a sweet, a gentle sweetness, yes. And it's an organic tea. It's really clean and a great length as well. It does linger, doesn't it? On the side of your tongue, there's very light tannins. I'm glad you like that. We go with a lot too. Do you know there are a lot of ways you can use it? Salads? Yeah, and some light desserts, citrusy desserts and things as well. This is a gastronomic, sometimes you have gastronomic wines, which you have to have something, you need to eat something with this. Yeah. You don't want to drink this in between. This is something you have to do something with it.",Success,"Lungjing green tea is a single‑region, organic tea from Hangzhou Province that is handmade into spear‑shaped strips rather than rolled, giving it a soft, herbaceous‑vegetable character with light tannins and a gentle sweetness. Its production method differs from typical Chinese teas and resembles Japanese sencha, resulting in an oily texture and an “oceanic” aroma reminiscent of nori, citrus, and salad notes. The tea is positioned for premiumization in hospitality, offering a high‑quality option for guests. It is recommended for culinary pairings such as salads, light citrus desserts, and other gastronomic applications rather than being consumed alone."
Fresh opulence with Opatha Estate Oolong,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm_fCwPYi88," Now this is a particularly nice one. This is an oolong that is made quite close to here on an estate called the Opata estate and it's made from the bud only. So today we saw the two leaves and bud but this is the bud only so you can see the whiteness in the leaf and it's not easy to do because from the bud, to harvest the bud, typically a tea picker who would harvest 18 kilograms of tea in a day would probably manage... 200 grams? For silver tips, but for this, the average was 500 grams. But still, that's not a lot. Yeah, because for the silver tips, we use a particular cultivar, which is very low yielding, so it's very hard. But this is spectacular. This is a gently, a very light fermentation. We fermented this for between six and six and a half minutes. So it's very gentle, so you have a light earthiness. So typically this is an unfermented tea. The oolong, which is a midpoint between the green and the black teas. Very light, it's got a silky body and exactly it's very fresh, it's really good easy drinking tea also.",Success,"The oolong described is produced on the Opata Estate from bud‑only harvests, with pickers typically collecting about 500 g of silver‑tip buds per day despite the cultivar’s low yield. The tea undergoes a very light fermentation lasting six to six‑and‑a‑half minutes, resulting in a lightly earthy flavor profile. It is classified as an unfermented oolong, positioned between green and black teas, and is noted for a silky body and fresh, easy‑drinking character."

Flavours of Europe with Ceylon Tea: Reviewed by Bocuse d’Or Judges!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85uM67D2IeU," So this is Chai. Now in the Swiss culinary tradition you have such incredible diversity. Is there something specific you can think of where we would be able to use this beautiful spicy tea? Of course, you know, we have cheeses, you know, cheeses fondue. You know, you can do actually juice with tea. It goes very well. And we would also be able to emulsify the fats. Exactly. It's actually instead of using kirsch, you know, usually we use kirsch, use tea. It would be very good. Brilliant. But now for the northern Italian tradition, tell me, I'm not too familiar with the northeast It's a very consistent cuisine, but what is there that is typical? It a cuisine where we mix a lot of the fruits also with the fruit Fruits and meat cheese and fruits so salty and sweetness And it goes together with it could work together very well with some teas because of the bitterness So we have a balance between cheese, fruits, meat, sweet, bitter, salty. I think it could work very well together. And maybe the second tea, the perfect Ceylon, I guess that could go quite well. I guess so, I guess so. fruity side of the dishes and also spices we use sometimes we use also cinnamon in our cuisine in Italy, pure cinnamon and smoked cheese could work very well together. And green tea, did you like the green tea? I'm used to a very different green tea because we use the Japanese green tea. Nothing to do with that. When you drink this one, you know, this is much finer. You know, it's so refined. I'm glad you're really glad you like it. So would an Italian consider drinking tea with his or her meal Robert A lot of Italians drink tea Yes Not only coffee A lot of Italians drink tea in the afternoon More in the north than the south right Yeah, more in the north than in the south. But maybe in the very real south, where you are close to Morocco, they used to drink also tea in the afternoon. Because they're close to Africa and close to their mint tea. The tradition. Moroccan mint tea. Yes. But I think it could work with a lot of dishes. It could be a good idea to bring more tea in the restaurant, in the menu, to offer the opportunity for people to taste it and go maybe to the sweet, more flavored teas with dessert and combine it together and for the children. Take them away from very sweet beverages and go on something kind of tea, maybe lighter. Excellent. So I looking forward to seeing what you decide after seeing the tea inspired offerings in Bokuzdo Well we learned a lot I mean I been now three four times with you on tea tasting and every time I learn so much more you know There so much more you know First time you think tea, but tea. Then you learn so much because it's like you say, it's like wine, you know. You have so many different characters and all this and it's amazing, you know. Lots of complexity. I mean, as older chefs, we have come a far way to accept tea in cooking. Something we grew up with, while today the younger generation, I guess, are using tea. No? Is that so? Absolutely, but it's my first time discussing tea with a Belgian, Italian and a Swiss person. But I'm happy to hear that we're talking. Of course, you should talk for the last time. You should not. Maybe we say cheers. We do a cheers on the camera. Cheers. Cheers to tea. Cheers.

The International Day for Biological Diversity - 2022,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ylzUSUwHPs," so do Thank you. On this International Day for Biological Diversity, we are joined by a very special person who needs no introduction. Mr. Dilhan Fernando is the CEO of Dilma and he is also the chairman of the board of directors of Biodiversity Sri Lanka. So hi Dilhan, how are you? Welcome. Very good to meet you. So we'll jump straight to the questions. What is biodiversity? You know, it's a richness of life around us. When you consider the importance of biodiversity to our lives or its relevance, it is the aesthetic value of greenery that you see. It has a huge subliminal psychological impact on peace and calm. But beyond the aesthetic is a simple functional value value because it is biological diversity that not only gives us the richness of life but also fuels the ecosystem services from the clean water to clean air. It is essentially the fabric that supports us aesthetically, functionally in literally every way and for us having involvement in a tea business It is particularly so because it is biodiversity that fuels the terroir in fine wine, in fine teas and so on. Okay, so daily we are hearing news of a lot of species growing extinct. What are these numbers? How many and why is this happening? The numbers are horrific. It's estimated at a loss of around 150 species daily, with over 50% lost since 1970, and that's of vertebrates alone. It's tragic because with the loss of these species, not only do you lose the diversity of life, but also we are losing opportunities to study more about life support systems, about medicine, more that we are learning. If you look at aerodynamics, the engineers, however brilliant they are, are studying nature, for example when you look at medicines it is nature that is providing us with clues to medication And in some cases it is elements in nature that we are replicating or synthesizing to produce medicines And there is a very real and tangible impact of biodiversity on our support systems. So if you can break it down for us, why are these species disappearing? Well, it's simply overconsumption. You have overfishing, you have exploitation of resources, you have mineral exploitation, drilling in the Amazon. You have every day we are seeing horrific figures about deforestation in the Amazon. You have people eating more beef than science advises us is sustainable. We are using the resources of the earth beyond what the earth can carry. They everything has a certain sustainable level and that sustainable level is defined as the point at which all species can coexist and I think it is coexistence that should be the key because we need to respect not only the functional benefit of biodiversity for us but also the fact that in coexisting we are ensuring our survival so biodiversity is critical to this but that equilibrium point is what we have passed over consumption in everywhere poaching hunting deforestation damaging the ecosystems that sustain biodiversity okay so why is it so important and why is it so worthy of protection well with biodiversity being really the fabric of life it is providing us with food it is providing us with medicine so if you have for example a monoculture typically you will suffer the possibility that that monoculture could could have pest infestation etc if you have a biodiversity with more more contemporary sustainable concepts of for example agroforestry where you respect biodiversity you go into a more natural environment where you have better biological natural containment of pests, natural containment of some of the threats to your crops. It's a more natural, sustainable way of coexisting because in a monoculture, as an example, you will have depletion of soils. You see that in the tea industry here, whereas if you have an agroforestry model, you have better circularity, you have the plants that are nourishing the soil, the soil that is nourishing whether it is tea plants or food or flowers or whatever you are growing in it, it is a more sustainable and viable way because ultimately we want to leave the earth in a better condition or at least as good a condition as we find it for the next generation. And that sustainability and biodiversity are key to that. What is being done to preserve biodiversity and its hotspots? Well, there is the Convention on Biological Diversity which brings 196 member countries together in identifying specific areas whether it is marine or terrestrial and it is an important convention but the significance of the convention is not in the agreement that has been made at CBD but rather in its execution So the execution requires the involvement of every one of us from individuals to businesses. The definition and the information is out there. Every week we see IPCC reports, we see different UN reports that tell us about accelerated deforestation in the Amazon, accelerated poaching, overfishing, different cataclysmic situations. We also see flooding in Australia, we see fires in the northern parts of Russia, we see unnatural things happening. So you have here the problem in the latter part and the solution in the former. So hoping that people will frame the problem and the fear of what we are seeing happening around us in what is most practical as its solution in the CBD that is our hope for the future. How much do you think it will cost to kind of rescue biodiversity? Well the estimates are varied from 500 billion dollars to two and a half trillion dollars but But remember that in protecting biodiversity, we are protecting businesses, we are protecting the aesthetics, we are protecting simply life as we know it. And so the reason why some may balk at that figure and saying look two and a quarter or two and a half trillion dollars is the fact that they do not currently ascribe a value to biodiversity, but when you actually try to value biodiversity, value the role of a bee and understand the role of pollination, not only in food production, but also in every other area that contributes to human welfare and human survival, then you get a true picture. That two and a half trillion dollars is really insignificant when you look at defence expenditure, you look at subsidies to the fossil fuel industry all of which are affecting biodiversity negatively so it needs to be framed in that context so what can corporates do to help there's a lot that corporates can do to help initially I think awareness is the most important element to stimulate action so spreading awareness help people understand what is biodiversity what does it mean the conversations we had for example the pharmaceutical companies could help explain how in many cases you have squid, you have fish, you have plants that have been the inspiration or the practical idea, the scientific idea behind certain medicines. Help people understand the value of biodiversity but beyond that is the tangible action. We need to look at more sustainable business and individual so that we arrest overconsumption, so that we arrest some of the unsustainable actions we are doing. So for example you can talk about people phones Phones are so important in life today but ultimately taking the model from inspired businesses that actually talk about circularity and sustainable living maybe we don need to produce a new model every six months and when a new model of iPhone comes out perhaps we don't need to encourage people to think about the next one which is what happens you have the rumors coming out and you create aspirations. So businesses need to responsible in helping people avoid over consumption, understand the situation, because being sustainable and protecting biodiversity doesn't mean that we have to compromise anything in our current lives. It actually means the converse. It means that we are going to have richer, more healthy lives because ultimately better quality of water, better air quality. All of these plus the simple fact when you go on holiday, typically you're not going to say I'm I'm going to go and spend my time in the center of the city. You're going to go to the beautiful rural areas. You're going to go to Kandy. You're going to go to Norelia, etc. You're going to go somewhere where you can appreciate nature. That aesthetic value, particularly at this point, when people are suffering such mental health challenges, but also the fact that there is a practical functional benefit. Ultimately, what more do I need to say than plants clean the air that we breathe, mangroves clean the water, they provide fish, they nurture ecosystems for prawns and in doing so they nurture the economic benefit for the local communities. There is incredible potential in understanding and in protecting biodiversity because it has a direct benefit on our economic activity but also on our personal health and well-being. So making people aware of that, I think is critical. So Dilhan, is there anything else you would like to add? Any message you would share with the viewers? Absolutely, yes. On this International Day for Biological Diversity, the theme is a shared future for all. My advice is, let's consider when we buy a new phone, when we want to buy a new car, is it a trend, is it a fashion, is it a necessity? Now, if we focus on what we need, rather than what we want. We can have a shared future for all. We can leave the world a better place for future generations. But we can also enrich our own lives, our businesses, the livelihoods of the fishermen, the livelihoods of the farmer and the agriculturalists. So it's a very simple principle. Let's live and act sustainably by focusing on a shared future for all. So thank you Dilhan for this wonderful chat. You've enlightened us about the importance of biodiversity and how we can all play a part and how corporates can help. So I hope you were all able to learn something from this and know that we can all play a part even in our small ways to help biodiversity. Thank you.",Success,"Dilhan Fernando, CEO of Dilma and chairman of Biodiversity Sri Lanka, explained that biodiversity provides both aesthetic value and essential ecosystem services such as clean water, air, and the terroir that underpins tea and wine production. He cited estimates that roughly 150 species are lost each day and that over 50 % of vertebrate species have disappeared since 1970, attributing the decline primarily to overconsumption—including overfishing, deforestation, mineral extraction, and unsustainable beef production. The Convention on Biological Diversity, signed by 196 countries, aims to protect hotspots, but implementation requires coordinated action from individuals, businesses, and governments, with financial needs estimated between US $500 billion and $2.5 trillion. Fernando urged corporations to raise awareness, adopt circular and agroforestry practices, and prioritize need‑based consumption to support a shared, sustainable future."

Dilmah celebrates 30 years in New Zealand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgoaKYRLz_M," Melissa in your 8 o'clock news coming up shortly. But first, it's one of those iconic brands that Kiwis have invited into their homes for 30 years now. And it turns out the connection between Sri Lanka and New Zealand has been integral in turning Dilma into the global success it now is. So, to celebrate the 30-year anniversary of Dilma Down Under, I caught up with the son of the company's founder, Dilhan Fernando. Dilhan, it's so nice to see you, my friend. How are you? Fantastic and really good to see you again. It's been a while. It's been far too long. We need to rectify that very, very soon. Over a cup of tea, of course. A hundred percent. Hey, how are you doing? Because I know it's a crazy time in Sri Lanka at the moment, but are you doing okay? Is everyone all right? It's challenging, but we're keeping, as you would say, keeping our chins up. And we are absolutely looking forward to what's next. You know, my father celebrates his 92nd birthday tomorrow, so we're excited about that. We focusing on the positives challenges there will always be but in faith we will get over them Well that brilliant to hear Can you believe that it been 30 years since your father started this company It's hard for us to comprehend. And the fact that these two families, my father and the Burton family in New Zealand, came together. And it was in a little garage. It was a parking garage, you know, that John's family had. And that's Dilma's very humble beginning in New Zealand. But all appreciation and tribute to the Kiwis. They knew a good thing when they saw it. And, you know, we have been blessed by that. Well, Dilma just feels like part of our DNA here in New Zealand. Can you explain to us how that relationship started? Because it really did start here in New Zealand for the company, didn't it? It's hard for us not to feel that New Zealand is part of our DNA because the people are nice, you have beautiful produce, you value the same things we value. And it's sincerity there. So when my father came to New Zealand and he partnered with wonderful people Darren Curtis who presented who helped him to craft his message he simply said honestly look this is my tea and this is what i love and i pick it pack it especially for you i do it ethically and please do try it and with that was was born a very sincere bond that continues even to this day and truly it's based on honesty simplicity and that's what my father represented then it's what we emulate now that line that do try it line has become so iconic and that was originated here in New Zealand wasn't it it is absolutely you know at that time my father was really in a quandary he couldn't afford celebrities people said you need to get this person and that person you should get this highfalutin agency involved but Darren Curtis came along and said look Meryl, you've got such a strong message, you love your tea, you're doing it for all the right things just come along and invite your customers please do try it And it was such a stroke of simple genius They say that the best things are based on simplicity and that exactly what it was So our wonderful Kiwi friend who still continues to be a great source of strength and encouragement, he was the one who coined that term and it is something that today has gone global and it is very much a Kiwi inspired phrase. What do you think it is that has created the long lasting success and durability of Dilma. You know, tea is such a wonderful herb. And I think for my father, his passion is based also on the fact that tea is social. It is something that brings people together. It brings families together. And for us, it's also about the goodness. Taste is important, yes, but tasting with people, tasting and knowing that the goodness is in there. And my father always told me, and he still tells me to this day, never compromise. We'll bring on the next 30 years and hopefully we'll see you again soon my friend. I will absolutely be back and I hope to bring my father too. It will be a joy to be back on Kiwi soil. Thank you Matty.",Success,"Dilma, a Sri Lankan tea brand, celebrated its 30‑year anniversary in New Zealand in 2024, marking three decades since founder Dilhan Fernando’s father established the company’s first New Zealand operation in a parking garage owned by the Burton family.

We do, we do indeed. We really really do and we're gonna make it for you now we're starting off with a shaker but ours is a water bottle because no one has a shaker at home so So, you're gonna do 120ml of tequila. You can use... Spirit is pouring. That's good. Yeah, that's right. You can use gin, you can use vodka, you could use white rum. Probably a white spirit. Oh yeah, yeah, white spirit, good shout, I like that. And of course it's all about the tea. So we've got one sachet of Earl Grey tea. If you have a loose leaf, that's fine, but I'm just gonna take it off, cut the little tips off and then pour it in. Now the reason why I do this is because I really like a cold infusion with the tea because it releases different aromas and as soon as you add water, of course, you're gonna dilute the cream. So we're gonna go straight in with that one. You should already smell that. I think that smells nice. Tequila and Earl's right, right? The breakfast side of things, strawberry jam. So that's about a tablespoon each, so two tablespoons. Let's do the maths on that one. Now any kind of citrus works with this You can use orange you could use lemon You could use lime you could use yuzu we really not fussy so it a silly little bit of sweetness and what we gonna do is we gonna go so we got two tablespoons of jam we gonna go about four tablespoons of lemon lime juice or in orange cases way about you know six because you want that slider city in orange okay so that goes Rosie, that's it. That is it. So we've got tequila, we've got Earl Grey from Dilma, we've got orange juice, we've got jam, breakfast martini style, big chunks of ice. Big chunks of ice in and we're gonna give it a shake. I'll get the glasses. That's awesome. And then sit it this way. I'm gonna go in. Look at that, we're kind of fine straining. Isn't that beautiful? Jammy. Very jammy. There we go. There we go. Look at the colour of that. What garnish? What garnish you got? I was going to go in. You know what, they're both going in.

We are three generations of tea farmers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vLeWVxM-oU," The first time I was taught how to make tea was on our Somerset estate. I was nine. My grandfather took me to the tea gardens at 4 a.m. and showed me how the tea leaves are hand-picked. That's where I learnt the first step in the art of tea making. It's all about the leaf. That's something only tea growers truly understand. For traders, it's about price and profit. For us, it's all about taste and goodness. That's because we love tea. We do not take shortcuts and we never compromise. Three, two, one. Do try it!",Success,"The speaker first learned tea preparation at age nine on a Somerset estate, where their grandfather took them to the tea gardens at 4 a.m. and demonstrated hand‑picking of tea leaves. They emphasize that understanding the leaf is essential to tea making, a perspective they attribute to tea growers.

The Complexities of the Human – Elephant Conflict,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4O3964Yhzg," Dr. Preeti Viraj Fernando, we're honored to have you on this conversation. Thank you. And I know you like to be called Prutu. Now you have an interesting history which I want to share with our listeners. You started and qualified as a medical doctor and then you decided that the elephants were calling. You have an incredible history. You have been in Oregon University in the US. You've studied the genetic ecology and conservation of the Asian elephant. You've gone on to Columbia University in New York. You conducted research on Asian elephants and the Javan rhinos. You've done field work in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, Borneo and Bangladesh. But thank goodness for Sri Lanka that you decided to return. We are truly blessed that you took that decision and today you are chairman of the Center for Conservation and Research. You're also a research associate with the Smithsonian Institute and you've received the Whitley Award for Nature Conservation and Presidential Awards for Scientific Excellence. Tutu, the president downwards, countries around the world have recognized you for your commitment to elephants and today we want to talk a little bit about elephants. Welcome. Thank you, Dylan, for that long introduction. Yeah, I'm always happy to talk about elephants. We're going to start with the inevitable. You know, we read about elephants, we see them, people talk about their majesty and so on. What is it that makes elephants special? We read about emotional sensitivity, we talk about or we hear about the structure of elephant herds, how they have their emotional connection, their sensitivity in terms of their relationships and they really sound unique but please tell us what really makes elephants special? Well I don't know what's not special about elephants you know if you I mean if you look at just look at an elephant i mean it's such a huge animal i mean it's the largest animal on land and then in addition to that it has this very strange appendage called a trunk which no other animal has it's like a fifth hand so just from from appearances itself i mean the males have tusks if it's african elephants both the males and females have tusks so it's it's something that is I would say very unique just by your parents but not only that even if you look at their social structure, their intelligence, their behavior, I think practically everything about elephants is very special. There's also often talk of how elephants really mourn and grieve and feel emotional stress in many situations. Is there anything that you have to add there? Clearly, so elephants are intelligent animals. They are also animals that have the capacity to recognize individuals and perhaps recognize themselves as individuals. So, So in a way, I mean, if you look at intelligence, we consider ourselves to be the most intelligent animal on earth. And elephants are also a very intelligent animal. So they have a very, very good memory. They have a very big brain, just the size of the brain. And so I think, like I said, every way you look at an elephant, it's very special, especially their social organization. So they have a very characteristic social organization where the males and females as adults have very different social structures. The females and the young live in groups and the males leave the groups when they come into puberty about 10 to 15 years of age and as adults they are single mostly solitary animals but still even the adult males of course because they associations with the herds maybe the herd they were born into as well as other herds that are in their area. But in addition to that, now we are beginning to realize that even the males themselves have a different social structure among themselves, between the individual males. Some males are hanging out together a lot of the time. So it's something very interesting. And practically most of what is known about elephant behavior has been based on African savannah elephant. There have been some very famous researchers who have worked on them for a very long time, very famous scientists. So we have a wealth of knowledge about their behavior. And we always assumed that it was the same for Asian elephants, but what we are seeing now is that it may not be so that Asian elephants have their own types of behavior and own social organization, which in principle may be somewhat similar to African elephants, but also is quite different from African elephants. Is it correct to say that like Sri Lankan society, that elephants are a matriarchal society? Yes, absolutely. because of this what we call sexually dimorphic social structure the males and the females having different social structures the females living in groups so now based again based on African elephants it has always been assumed that there is a leader which is the oldest female in a group And so from a structural point of view, the oldest female, the group is composed of a female, her young, and their own young, and mostly the females, the female offspring, as well as the younger males. so in a single herd you might have about three generations of elephants so it has always been assumed that the oldest female the grandmother of them all or maybe even the great-grandmother of them all plays a leading role and has been named a matriarch and this is something that has been seen in African savannah elephants but when we look at the eye elephants Asian elephants as well as particular Sri Lankan elephants, we don't see a clear leadership role for the oldest female. So you can identify often the oldest female in a group, but she doesn't seem to show such a strong leadership role. And also the group, the groups in Asian elephants tend to be somewhat smaller than with African elephants. So there's a lot that we really don't know about Asian elephants, even though strange enough it's the Asian elephants that have had the closest association with people for thousands of years, but we still really don't know much about them at all. So Prutu, amongst your other accolades and recognitions, the President of Sri Lanka has invited you to find a solution to the human elephant conflict and that's a huge responsibility but the conflict itself is tragic. Is there a way that we can manage this conflict sustainably? Absolutely but it's not easy. So human elephant conflict is a very complex thing and the thing is Now, clearly when there is conflict between two groups, when it's humans and elephants or humans and humans or whatever, clearly both parties suffer from the conflict. So yes, elephants suffer and people suffer. But when it comes to human-elephant conflict, we really mostly ignore the elephant We focus practically only on the human aspect of human-elephant conflict. So the best example of that is if you look at the measures that we take to mitigate the human conflict the main methods are we capture elephants put them in a truck take them far away and dump them in some far away remote protected area We drive elephants out of the areas that they have been born and been living for generations. We drive them by force away from those lands and restrict them to some protected area and put up a fence. We distribute firecrackers to farmers to confront elephants and throw these firecrackers at them. So I'm not saying that any of these are wrong as such, but the point is these are only directed towards finding a solution or more to manage the problems that people have from elephants. And in fact, many of these measures actually cause a lot of problems for elephants. So, but looking at it, even from a people's point of view, the unfortunate thing is that we have thought that this is something very simple, that you can do one thing and solve the problem forever. But it is something very complex. I mean, people are very complex, elephants are very complex. So inevitably the conflict is a very complex thing. It differs from place to place, area to area, depending on the people, depending on the elephants, depending on the location. So there are a lot of complexity. But the main thing is there is nothing, no one thing that any one group or person can do that's going to solve this. So in order to manage the conflict, lots of agencies, lots of people have to come together and a lot of things need to be done. to be done and that needs a very strong leadership to make that happen. Putu, there's lots of discussion about elephants in zoos and so on and I know it becomes a heated argument because of the social structure that we spoke of. What is your opinion? What's your take on that is it you know from an educational research I guess a charismatic perspective is it acceptable to have two or three elephants in the zoo or what is I'm sorry I'm probably asking a difficult question and if you prefer not to answer that's fine but I'm interested to know your perspective. So yes, so there is the broader aspect of elephants in captivity per se which is and elephants in zoos are a subsection of that. So just from an elephant point of view, if you have a single animal, given that as you say that they have such a social structure, whether even the males, it's probably not a great thing for that elephant. So, and then you have degrees of captivity and the degrees of how much interaction these animals have with other animals, other elephants, as well as even people. So again, it's not a black and white thing. There's lots of shades of grey here. of shades of gray here. So currently most international zoos are going away from having one or a single animal or one or two elephants in captivity. So they are trying to form a social group if they have elephants so that they have some sort of social structure. So that I think is a good thing. But also many Western zoos particularly have become very adverse to one-on-one interaction with elephants. That's partly driven by the possible potential danger to people who interact with elephants. And number of people have got killed through the years. So now if you actually have a sufficient number of telephones and they are in a large enough area that they can interact with each other they have social interactions I think that provides perhaps the best possible situation for an elephant in captivity If you fall short of that, you already have elephants in captivity, which are maybe single or maybe one or two animals. And you cannot provide for them to have a larger group and the surroundings. In that situation, if the elephant cannot even have that sort of social interaction with people, I think it is a very sad situation for that animal. Prutu, with all these challenges, what's happening to elephants around the world, whether Africa, Asia, Sri Lanka and so on? I mean generally. I think elephants are symptomatic of all the other species. Most other species, as you know, are doing pretty badly and doing well every day. It's only a very, very few species who have managed to live with us. Things like cockroaches and rats and things like that are doing pretty well. But all the animals, all the other animals, most of them are doing badly and was on a day by day basis. So with elephants, for any animal, I mean we change the environment so much that most animals can no longer live in that environment. So habitat loss and environment is, I would say, the biggest threat to elephants as well as all these animals. But with elephants, there are additional issues. So with African elephants, a huge problem is deporting for tusks. I mean how pathetic is that? We are killing these majestic animals, we are slaughtering them just for the sake of two teeth. So that is a huge problem in Africa. And then the human elephant conflict, that's probably a bigger problem in Asia than in Africa, but even in Africa it's becoming a bigger problem. and in Asia it's I would say the biggest threat secondary to the habitat loss which is also associated with the conflict for elephants. Well we must hope that with all the signs around us that our humanity will wake up. I think there was even in the last week, there was some terribly disturbing reports about how we are ourselves creating or fueling an existential threat to humanity. But I guess that's a subject of another and much longer podcast. I want to conclude Prutu with an interesting question that I know many will be interested to know the answer to. Are elephants really afraid of mice? Well, elephants, if there was an elephant that had not met a mouse before, he would be very scared of the mouse. Elephants like ourselves, I suppose, like all animals, fear the unknown. So anything that is new, that is strange, that they have not experienced before, they would be scared of. but elephants are also extremely adaptable and pretty intelligent. So in a little while I'm pretty sure that he will overcome his fear of mice. Thank you very much Prutu. Prutu, it's really been an honor chatting with you. You are an incredibly accomplished person with tremendous integrity in the field and I'm really privileged that we are able to share your thoughts in this conversation with our audience. Prutu, thank you very much. We are honored to have had you on the show and I wish you a wonderful weekend. Thank you very much, Dylan. It's been a pleasure.",Success,"Dr. Preeti Viraj Fernando (Prutu) earned a medical degree, a PhD in genetic ecology and conservation of the Asian elephant at Oregon University, and conducted research on Asian elephants and Javan rhinos at Columbia University"

Robert Piasecki reimagines Dilmah tea in 3 ways!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtwsvrcwFTc," When I was creating this dessert, I was thinking about the positive effect of food on our body. That's why I use Dilma Mint Tea as my base. I prepared Dilma Mint Tea in three versions here, as a foam, gel and also a flavor of ice cream. Let's move on to the mocktail. The competition topic is immunity inspired. That's why I choose C-bacturn as my base and I pair it with Dilma, ginger and honey tea. C-bacturn is a real vitamin bomb. Also, back in the days, this ingredient was very popular in Poland during World War I. Dried C-bactone replaced synthetic vitamin C, which protects people's immunity system. What is more, research shows that C-bactone has an anti-cancer effect. So 20 liters in a portion. It's very hard in non-alcoholic cocktails to get a proper balance. So that's why I add two springs of rosemary. Dear judges, I present to you Resistance 3. Thank you so much.",Success,"The creator used Dilma Mint Tea as the base for a dessert, preparing it in foam, gel, and ice‑cream forms.

We can achieve that by breaking out the unfair international trading system by going straight to the farmer, the farmer who loves tea and dreams of a better future for their families and the community. That is why I made my Dilma a business that serves humanity, not for profit, but for a better future for all.",Success,"The speaker was raised in a rural family, citing parental influence—particularly from their mother—and personal faith as shaping their values of humility, kindness, and honesty. They note that the regional tea industry operates within an exploitative colonial framework yet supports more than two million people directly and indirectly. To address this, they propose bypassing the unfair international trading system by connecting consumers directly with tea‑growing farmers. Accordingly, they founded a venture called Dilma, described as a non‑profit enterprise aimed at improving the livelihoods of farmers and their communities."
Merrill: A Life Devoted to Tea -The right way or the profitable way,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgfZ83MamaQ," When I started in tea, there were hundreds of family companies, each passionate about quality and freshness, focused entirely on bringing you fine quality tea. I could never imagine a time when they would be acquired by some giant traders in tea. Sadly, that has happened. It has made my sons, my grandchildren and I more and more determined to fulfill the purpose behind our family business. That is the foundation of my Dilma. Today people who neither know nor care about tea make decisions about tea. Sitting in one country contract packing their teas in another using tea from wherever it is cheap purely for profit that's not good for tea or for you for people who work so hard to make good tea or for tea drinkers who expect a cup of good taste and good health every business must honor the people that nurture it it's the right thing to do",Success,"The speaker observes that the tea sector has moved from hundreds of family‑owned companies dedicated to quality and freshness to consolidation by large trading firms, prompting his family to reaffirm the purpose of their own business, Dilma. He criticizes current practices in which unrelated parties contract‑pack tea across borders using the cheapest sources solely for profit, arguing that this harms tea quality, the workers who produce it, and consumers seeking taste and health benefits. He asserts that any tea business should honor the people who nurture the product."
Merrill: A Life Devoted to Tea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xF4vJiI7qc," It's 70 long years since I started to pursue my love for tea. Nearly 33 years since I first invited you to try my tea. Do try it. And it was the first time a farm had offered tea direct from source to consumers. They call me a disruptor. But I didn't offer my tea direct to customers with the intention of disrupting anybody's business. Fresh tea is simply better because it has more flavour and more antioxidants. It makes sense, therefore, for us to grow, pick, perfect and pack our teas right where it is grown and then send it as fresh as possible to our customers. He also wanted the earnings from my tea to benefit my country, its ailing economy and my workers. Great taste, natural goodness and ethical purpose. That's why.",Success,"The speaker has pursued a passion for tea for 70 years and began inviting others to try their product 33 years ago, marking the first instance of a farm selling tea directly from source to consumers. Their model emphasizes growing, harvesting, processing, and packaging the tea at the origin to deliver it as fresh as possible, citing higher flavor and antioxidant content. The business aims to channel earnings toward supporting the national economy and its workers. The brand positions its offering around taste, natural benefits, and ethical purpose."

The Boy Who Loved Tea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5muM-zJDBFc," Once you tasted my Dilma, you tasted the finest tea. Do try it. I devoted my life to tea. Can you believe that for 70 long years, I have treaded these roads up and down morning and evening. My early morning walks freezing. Nature is amazing. When the leaf begins to grow overnight, nature does its job perfectly. And we are able to pick the leaf and produce a wonderful livery. Nature is our greatest asset. Nothing else, no fertilizer, no chemicals can do to a tea plant or a tea bush what nature does. Thaithi, what's your advice for making the perfect cup of tea? I will show you. Now, this is where it all begins. Two leaves and a bud. Morning sunshine, afternoon showers, cold nights. All belong to nature. They produce the perfect cup of tea. I am so particular about protecting nature that on this Dankil estate we have some 20 leopards on that ridge You wouldn't believe the villagers were dead scared of them, but now they have come to terms and they don't harm either party. So that's how protective I have been of nature. I came from a humble home in a little village. I had a dream to give consumers the finest tea on earth and workers a better life. Can you see our workers' homes? We are improving them through our efforts. We are not following what others do. We make our, create our own paths. For 70 years, I have been in pursuit of a fairer deal for farmers. And I have ended up making my Dilma a matter of human service. People call me the tea maker, but it's nature that makes the perfect cup of tea. you",Success,"The speaker, who has worked in tea cultivation for 70 years, manages the Dankil estate where tea is harvested from two‑leaf‑and‑bud plucks under natural conditions of morning sun, afternoon showers, and cold nights. The estate maintains a population of about 20 leopards on a ridge, which local villagers have learned to coexist with. The producer emphasizes that no fertilizers or chemicals are used, relying solely on natural processes to create the “Dilma” tea brand. Efforts also include improving workers’ housing and securing fairer trade terms for farmers."

The Rhythm of Nature – A Tribute to the Most Experienced Teamaker,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXU-1uiRtfY," Welcome to Tea Inspiration. They are the line of three teas that were designed and made as a tribute to none other than to a man who devoted his life to tea. When my father turned 90 on May 6th this year we presented him these three teas which symbolize his commitment of 70 years in tea. Now that commitment is very special because it echoes something that we're going to do today. It echoes his love for tea to spend a lifetime devoted to this beautiful herb. There has to be something special about his tribute. Now I have here with me an artist of a slightly different art but still no less echoing nature and he's going to show you a little hint of his art before he shows us much more. Maybe we can get a hint of what we are going to see Ravi? Yes, okay. As you have a range of teas here, it's all tea but different teas of different nature Here is one drum that can produce sounds of different natures And we are going to see more of that. So hold on to your seats, get ready for an experience that is unique. Ravi Bandhu is an artist that Sri Lanka celebrates. His understanding and his respect for percussion mirrors exactly my father's love for tea. And where two passions meet, you know there's going to be something fantastic. So we have an artist with passion and we are going to challenge him. You know they say that when you make tea, you have to produce fine tea by using the traditional method. And the traditional method involves taking the leaf, rolling it, and you roll it to bring out the juices. And that's what we're going to do with Ravi. And this is a challenge that has never been put before to a musician of his caliber and with the Sri Lankan heritage. I going to ask you Ravi or challenge you to produce a melody that might incorporate all of this Because when we designed these teas for my father we produced them specially they were produced in january we harvested we produced the teas and we had on craighead estate the celebration peko it is a spectacular tea and it expresses the lightness of a black tea so it has that oakiness it has that beautiful woody character that is appreciated in tea a very regal tea yes and maybe I can offer you this which is also a black tea and which is our sapphire peco from Endane State. It is a little different and then finally also from Emerald Hills we have this spectacular green tea, Ceylon Green. So you have three very different teas but all very regal teas. Yeah so from on Cricade Estate, you have in that valley a particularly unique terroir. And that is what you're seeing here. It's bright, it's soft, it's a little floral. Endana sandy soils it hot it short range and so you have finally that softness of a beautiful loose leaf Ceylon green tea from Emerald Hills Now I going to ask you to express that in a in a tribute which I would like you to present to my father. Well I'm going to play a glorious section from Magul Berra the ceremonial drums as a tribute to a a great son of Sri Lanka. Thank you. Magnificent. I couldn't think of a better way of paying tribute to my father's lifetime in tea. Thank you Ravi. We are honored. And what a beautiful expression, acoustic expression of the beauty of nature in these teas. Thank you very much Ravi. Thank you.",Success,"On May 6 2024 the speaker’s father turned 90, marking 70 years of involvement in tea, and was presented with three specially created teas as a tribute.

The Rhythm of Nature with Green Tea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIsckcWdnQ8," Today we are going to explore a different aspect of nature in a very different sense. We are a part of nature and drumming or percussion is said to be an insight into the soul. The drum echoes the heartbeat after all. And today we are going to look at these different aspects of nature. how wind, how rainfall, how sunshine and soil, heaven, earth and ultimately man craft the character, the personality, the brightness, the texture, the flavor, the goodness in tea and how that echoes in a different sort of a rhythm. The rhythm of nature reflected in the rhythm of Ravi Bandhu's drums. This is a green tea using a tradition that is around 3,000 years old. It combines the petals of jasmine and natural jasmine to soften it and what it does is it balances the astringency of the tea in this light aromatic gentle tea. It has certain softness, it has sweetness, it's very gentle on the palate and the aftertaste is also gentle. It's all about harmony but gentle harmony. So I know with percussion it might be a little difficult but I know you can do it. Any of these drums can play very gentle sounds and very aggressive sounds as well A note is like the heart of a music piece Percussions are made for playing rhythms that stem from the heartbeat. But then note how these different notes, notes as you feel these different tones of flavors in different parts of the tongue in the mouth. How not simply the rhythms but different notes are created out of the drums. For example, if I play this, So it makes a melody. See, it's not simple, but then when I put it into a framework of a rhythm cycle, So it soft and creates different notes not simply rhythms but within a time cycle That beautiful and in fact melody is very appropriate because this next tea that we are going to look at is actually a melody It a melody in tea in fruit It combines a fine mid-grown Ceylon tea, right? Little bit oaky but also combines fruit notes and here we have a little bit of citrus so you have that spectacular sensuous sweetness of strawberry it's almost a fleshy sweetness you have a little bit of raspberry which is different it's a little harsher little bit more tart but all coming together and the melody comes from the tea okay let's try to do it without any of these drums. The drum syllables, all these drums have a very rich, highly codified drum languages. See for example the tabla now don't take a good any any syllable can be verbally uttered on this tank or don do so I try to express that feeling through a combination of drum some syllables express verbally that combines some of these drums And also bringing a melodic aspect to it. 30 years. 32 years wieder to dni the 사�亮aires a strange Oftentimes to fly brews 2 foot That was magnificent, magnificent. Truly a walk through a fragrant orchard and exactly expressing this inspirations, berry sensation. And you know the adventure is going to continue, this experience, because next we're going to have to experience it with food. Great. We will try culture, tea, percussion and Sri Lankan food. Lovely. Thank you. Thank you.",Success,"The presentation connects percussion rhythms to tea flavor profiles, citing Ravi Bandhu’s drums as an illustration of how heartbeat‑like beats mirror taste sensations. It describes a green tea made with a 3,000‑year‑old jasmine tradition that softens astringency with gentle sweetness, and a mid‑grown Ceylon tea blended with citrus, strawberry and raspberry notes that form a “melodic” palate. The speaker notes that drum syllables—such as those of the tabla—can be vocalized and combined to create melodic patterns analogous to flavor layers. The session concludes with a plan to experience tea, percussion, and Sri Lankan food together, referencing 30–32 years of related practice."
The Rhythm of Nature with the Four Varieties of Tea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_WnexZMQQ8," Welcome to Tea Inspiration. Tea is fantastic on its own. It's an expression of nature. Tea with food, incredible. It dignifies food. Tea with beverage, fantastic. I've tried some of the most amazing tea cocktails you would not believe. But that's for another day. But today we're going to talk about tea with music and specifically with percussion. The drums are an echo of the human heartbeat. And so in a sense, drums and the art of percussion, it's a window to the soul. Tea is an expression of nature. We are a part of the biological diversity in nature. And so today we are going to explore two different aspects of nature with the experience of tea from the sense of hearing and connecting that with pairing it beautifully with tea in terms of its flavor, its taste, its aroma and its fragrance. And I have someone very special who's going to do that with us. It is the multi-generational artist Ravi Bandhu. Ravi is a maestro in Sri Lankan traditional drums, but he's going to tell you a little bit more about it himself. Drumming is the art of expressing rhythm, rhythm that we fathom, rhythm that we grasp from all over, from the universe, from the nature, and also the rhythm that is born within ourselves and that too based on the heartbeat la-dub la-dub la-dub la-dub la-dub la-dub la-dub la-dub la-dub la-dub la-dub la-dub isn't it a really amazing thing so well talking a little bit about myself I'm coming from a traditional family of dancers, temple painters and drummers. For over eight generations now. So drumming is really in my blood and I really can't wait without playing. It need not be a drum, a proper drum, but any surface, even on my cheeks. Impressive. But what are you doing with this pot? Are you going to cook for us Ravi or are you going to come? I am interested to know what it is doing here, this pot. This is a traditional instrument from South India called ghatam, which means pot. And it's made out of red clay mixed with copper and brass dust and stone dust. And this is a special art, actually, the making of the drum. And there are traditional families in South India who make these musical pots. but as I told you before it contains rhythm. Fantastic Ravi. So today we are going to see how we can translate that rhythm into a pleasurable experience. You know today I think for us we love what we do right? I think passion it's the love that we have for our art. I love tea, I love the influence of nature on tea, I love the fact that tea is so infinite in its variety and we've seen your love, we've experienced it and we have heard it so in combining the two we're going to start with the tea that you told me is your favorite. It's an Earl Grey tea. Yes. So you have here You have here a tea that has its foundation in a low elevation tea It is from the region around Ratnapura where we have our Kahawatha Tea Gardens You have intensity there you have the sunshine that is producing strength and character in the tea giving it much more depth than the lightness and the brightness that you see here at Dunkill at 4000 feet above sea level. And that is combined in a tradition that goes back to the 1800s with citrus, with the Bergamot, with oil of Bergamot, which is a fruit. It's from the citrus orange family. And it gives it that sweetness. It gives it a fruity character. And it gives it the pleasant, slightly pungent orange with a little bit of bitterness. but a very pleasant bitterness. So this bergamot is in a sense a more complex, less sweet version of what we know as an orange. Not our Sri Lankan orange, but what we know as a typical orange in terms of its sweetness and balance. So let's see what you're going to do with this. Well, as Earl Grey is one of my favorite teas, I'm going to combine it with my favorite drum, the traditional Gata Beret or the Candian drum. As you just pointed out, Earl Grey tea has different tastes or different flavours. Different notes. Different notes, exactly. So let's try to combine it with the different notes of the candy and drum that gives the soft aspects as well as the not really the hard but more powerful aspect. Beautiful Ravi, I can almost hear the Earl of Grey's footsteps as he comes here and joins us in this harmonious interaction of tea and your beautiful art. So now we're going to move on to another English tradition but actually not a lot English about it this is a beautiful Ceylon tea Sri Lankan tea it's called Ceylon tea because people knew Sri Lankan tea as Ceylon from the time it was called Ceylon and and the name persists simply because of people's familiarity typically this tea is bright and strong it needs to be strong because at 4 o'clock in the morning when the Scottish planters back then the pioneer planters when they woke up and came to muster on these hills they were cold they were sometimes wet as we were this morning we experienced exactly what was required what they did and then they wanted something warm strong to really wake them up and to also help them through the day at that time you know they had to battle leopard we have leopard up on the ridge here but at that time there were many more there were elephant you know there were many elephants until thomas far destroyed many of them but there were so many wild animals, so many challengers, they had to fight malaria and so many things. So they needed intensity and strength and that we provide to this day, uncompromising the same formula. And it is brightness, strength, woodiness. You know, a good Ceylon tea has the balance of the light, bright, almost citrus, it's almost lemony. But also it has the depth. It is a rounded character that is neither light and bright nor strong and intense but bridges it and you have some texture you have what we call the gut so that comes from the polyphenols in the tea the antioxidants the goodness in the tea and it coats the tongue so that is a good Ceylon tea a good breakfast tea and that's what this is so that's your challenge translate that and express it in percussion well you said that people in the past they needed some kind of strong stimulation with a pick me up kind of feeling so that connects me to this drum which is this is tammatama, that is played early morning in the temple. And to that sound the people woke up. So the rhythm is also uncompromising, because the drummer had to learn all the rhythms, know it by heart, and never could he mix it with any other patterns or improvisation. but he had to play that fixed pattern every morning. So let's try and match this quality of the Thammahtama and also the balance of the playing between the two faces. It continues like that but then I played part of it. Ravi, I'm glad that you weren't around in the 1800s because if you were, we might not have had this tea. We might not have had English breakfast because the planters would have woken up. You would have played the tamattama and I would have been out of a job. 50 years later but beautiful a perfect expression of the two the brightness the vitality the life force coming up and really expressing itself which is what this tea does it is exactly what your rhythm did so now we are coming a little bit lower a little bit away from the Dimula Valley we're coming lower in the elevation of Sri Lanka we are coming somewhere between Dimula between Hatton and Ratnapura. And now this tea, our premium Ceylon single origin, it's an expression of the soul of Ceylon tea. It is balanced, it has richness, medium intensity. So it is what you would call a tea that is generally accepted to a person who enjoys tea. It's an all-day drinking tea. So it is neither light nor bright. Well, of course, it has some brightness. But it is neither on this side of the spectrum nor on this side. So it is somewhere in between, offering an assortment of different characters that makes it a pleasing all-day drinking tea. You can have it in the morning, you can have it in the afternoon, you can have it in the evening, you can have it at night. And it has a beautiful character. It is really the soul of Sri Lanka. to me. Well, that connects me to this particular drum, which I myself developed from the traditional basis. In our traditional literature, we have a kind of drum called Kala Bhera or Kumba Bheri or Kala Bhera pot drums. So I wanted to develop this drum to give a kind of a not really serene but a kind of a neutral tone that is not harsh to the ear nor it is light like this Perfectly expressed Ravi, perfect. The soul of Sri Lanka. And that's a beautiful pairing. This is, I mean, since it is my own development, I wouldn't say creation because it's something that I developed from the traditional drums. So I feel very close to it. It's perhaps my soul. It has a unique sound. Thank you. And it's my soul. Wonderful. Wonderful. What better? So we should rename this, the soul of Ravi. Great. One day. Thank you. I'm honored. So we started in the Dibbulla Valley. We headed down towards Ratnapura and now we go a little bit further down in the Ruhunu region. And where we are ending up is a tea that has intensity, that has a little bit of a malty earthy note. note what we know as low country tea from estates like Nilagamara like this this kind of near near Gaul and so on so you have here heat you have humidity you have sandy soils producing this strength producing this intensity it's what we call our extra strength tea and it has it so for people who drink tea with milk I don't so I take it like this this is a tea that gives them balance so it has strength it has earthiness it has maltiness those are the notes and I know that you have something for this well exactly yes the low country drum with low country tea perfect this is the drum that represents the entire low country dance culture and I say low country it's the the southern lowlands of Sri Lanka mainly and the playing is also very intense in this That kind of playing with some muted sounds also has this kind of very earthy feeling. It's very well grounded. It exactly, perfectly matches what we have here. Now, you told me earlier, Ravi, that this drum is something a little bit unique, that it also is made from the intestine of the cow. Yes, exactly. This is a rare thing. I haven't heard of any other musical instrument in the world that uses the intestine of the cow. Fantastic. And you know, it's these stories and it's this truth that gives colour to the passion that you and I have and helps us to share this with people who are watching, watching, who hopefully this knowledge inspires them to passion. Thank you Ravi. Yeah, thank you. That's a beautiful synergy. It's wonderful. Indeed. Thank you so much.",Success,

How wind, how rainfall, how sunshine and soil, heaven, earth and ultimately man craft the character, the personality, the brightness, the texture, the flavor, the goodness in tea and how that echoes in a different sort of a rhythm. The rhythm of nature reflected in the rhythm of Ravi Bandhu's drums. Ravi, welcome to Dunk Elder State. Thank you. You have shared with me a little introduction to your art and of course everyone in Sri Lanka and many people around the world have heard your art. I want to talk to you a little bit about my art. Oh, that's great. And like you, and from the heritage of your famous father, of course in a different art, Mr. Soma Bandhu, yourself, Mr. Ravi Bandhu, I inherit my art from my father, Meryl Fernando. And here we see in Dankhild, and particularly in the amazing combination of different weather patterns that we have seen whilst we have been here, we see the expression of the art of tea Because tea is an expression of nature and that is really the essence of tea because in the leaf is not simply a leaf but it is that combination of the brightness of the sunshine it is the the soil it is the the wind conditions I mean this wind that fanning us today and making us cold right now is what concentrates a lot of the you see the queue we have the beautiful sunshine and the sunshine is what brings brightness brings really that that spectacular oaky character in a nice bright tea that we in Sri Lanka like but we invited you here as a master of your art for a very important reason because tea was first discovered by Emperor Shen Nung the divine harvester and he discovered it as a medicine as something so good for humanity and in a sense he discovered it for its philosophical aspect he discovered it for the calm the peace that it offers but also for the functional benefit and latterly for the taste and so when I try to understand something about percussion and its relationship with tea, I see an amazing connection. Right, exactly. Because your art, the drums echo the heartbeat and it is said in traditional drumming that it is an insight into the soul and so I cannot imagine a better combination Tell us a little bit about your art Well Dilan I like to start from the about passion. You do this with a passion, a great passion in the art of growing tea. The famous American modern dancer Martha Graham has said that great people become great not because of their work but because of their passion towards their work. So to become a drummer or a dancer, especially traditional drumming, one needs to have that passion for it. Love. the love for it, the passion to do it all the time, to live the art. Yes. Simply to live the art. As you said, drumming really starts from the heartbeat. And we human beings are rhythmic animals. Every move that we take, you know, like even when you walk the land, you really walk to a kind of a three beat rhythm. Drumming actually is, as you said, like tea. like tea, it's the expression of nature through an instrument. Drum is the primary, the primordial and primary instrument of the mankind. The early man created the drum to express his own heartfelt feelings and unknowingly he grasped his own rhythm and fathomed the rhythm of the nature and even the universe We believe also in family values and I'm so glad to see that you brought your son along for this so that he together with my son and you and I that we can express our art in a very different way. Art is all about expressing your soul in any form of art. In the art of tea, in the art of drumming and music, or in visual arts, in dance, because I'm primarily a dancer. I mean, I can't do without moving. I'm itching to move all the time. But as of now, I want to see others move. choreographer I would always like to see my dancers you know take the form that I give them and then it is rhythm that connects me and the dancers and then amongst them the rhythm connects then it's beautiful now we're going to explore rhythm with a similar beauty and I'm looking forward to that because the rain is just coming over the hills sure and I think it's going to chase us away from here so I'm looking forward to trying that rhythm yeah looking forward to the new experience that's it with drums that's it welcome again Ravi and let's go and try the tea with drums",Success,"Ravi Bandhu, a Sri Lankan percussionist and son of the late Soma Bandhu, discussed his drumming art with host Dilan, who traces his own tea‑growing heritage to his father Meryl Fernando. They linked the rhythmic qualities of traditional drumming—described as echoing the human heartbeat—to the sensory attributes of tea, noting that factors such as sunshine, soil, wind, and rainfall shape the leaf’s flavor and character. The conversation referenced Emperor Shen Nung’s historic discovery of tea as a medicinal and philosophical beverage.

As with everything in our culture, there is a story behind it. There's an amazing story behind these teas, and there is an equally amazing story that our master, Ravi Bandhu, is going to share with us. You can make your own tea, can't you? Absolutely. So you make your own tea, you put water and you make it either strong or light, or add a little milk, add a little sugar if you like. Likewise, the traditional drummer, he selects the wood, he carves it, and he gets all these natural skins to create a drum. I never knew that, but it's that that brings the drums to life. rather than simply hearing the sound, you hear heritage and you feel the soul of what you're doing. So now I want to share with you a little bit more of my passion and my art. The most popular tea in the world is English breakfast grown in these beautiful hills It was originally the Scottish planters and Ravi back then those planters would wake up for master at 4 a at that time they needed something strong and bracing to warm them up and to prepare them for the day but then we also said there's nothing English about tea and so what we did was we produced something that we call tropical breakfast. It has nice strength, flavour and texture typical of a beautiful Ceylon tea from this region. But then we added some critical ingredients. Our heritage is a lot about wellness. It's about Ayurveda. So what you have in here are turmeric, fresh coconut desiccated of course for shelf stability but there's a combination of strength of woodiness so there is some intensity but from the aramisu you have the sweetness you have from the coconut you have that beautiful nutty character it's tropical so we call it tropical breakfast well that reminds me of the early morning temple drums that we play exactly at 6 the The tam-met-tama, this traditional drum, gives that kind of a warm kind of sound and may sound a little tough. That gives the stimulation to anybody. Ravi, you have captured in your words exactly what this tea is about because it's about warmth, it's about energy, it's about vitality. Thank you.",Success,"Ravi Bandhu, a tea master, explains that the traditional tea tasting begins with a cultural story linking tea preparation to drum‑making, emphasizing heritage and wellness. The “English Breakfast” tea originally served Scottish planters who rose at 4 a.m. for a strong, bracing brew, but was later reformulated as “Tropical Breakfast” using Ceylon tea’s strength and texture combined with turmeric, fresh coconut and desiccated coconut for shelf stability, creating a wood‑sy, nutty, sweet profile. The blend aligns with Ayurvedic principles of vitality, warmth and energy. Its flavor is likened to the early‑morning temple drum (tam‑met‑tama) played at 6 a.m., whose resonant sound is intended to stimulate listeners."
"Arana Natural goodness, inspired by 3,000 years of Sri Lankan Ayurveda",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XULks295Nw," Hi everyone, I'm Dilhan Fernando from Dilma. I want to present our new Arana line. Arana, in our language, Sinhala, it means the inner part of the forest, the most sacred part of the forest, where herbs, spices that were useful in Ayurvedic natural traditional medicine, traditional healing, were grown. It was accessed only by the physician or the village headman. We're a tea company. We love Ceylon tea, green tea, black tea, oolong and the finest white tea. But today we're talking about natural herbal infusions because consumers are more sensitive than ever before to natural goodness. Arana is different because it represents a tradition of over 3,000 years. It involves herbs and spices, whether it is moringa or ginger, whether it is sasa parilla, ashwagandha, whether it is tea, the green tea that's in some, the black tea in some, the rooibos or the honey bush that are in others. Each of the ingredients very carefully selected, handpicked by artisans and the combinations determined by Ayurvedic physicians Each of these products approved by Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Council which is a steward of a 3 tradition taking sleep as an example something that is more critical than ever today in these stressful times. We have a combination of honeybush, which has that beautiful honey-like taste. It's light, it's gentle, it's fabulous in the evening, but combining the incredible potency of gotukola, of Indian Sasa Parilla and Hatha Varya. All natural, traditional, plant-based, antioxidant-rich herbs. Now why all that is important is that the world is moving towards vegan, plant-based goodness. But it's not just goodness because it is goodness with a story. For us as tea growers and as Sri Lankans growing on our plantations, many of these herbs, the cinnamon, the cardamom, the cloves, the Moringa. Growing all of these with a lot of passion, our commitment is to ensuring their authenticity and their quality. And our collaboration with the Ayurvedic Council is to ensure that what we do complies perfectly with authenticity, with the recipes and ensures that it delivers that Ayurvedic goodness And so another detox the natural detox Here you have a combination of of holy basil of honey bush and also Indian sasaparilla But youth you have Ceylon black tea with its natural antioxidant goodness combined with moringa, with ginger, with star anise, with black pepper and cinnamon. Each of these known for a specific natural health benefit. So what is important about Arana is not that it is a product that presents good taste and it does offer good taste. Yes, it's herbal, but the world is ready for something different. It is an evolution of the herbal tea or the herbal infusion segment that has been growing the category for so many years. But it is an evolution because it is in the direction of authenticity. And so when you taste Awake, as an example, with its green tea base, you have a very clear taste resolution that depicts the ashwagandha balanced by peppermint. Ashwagandha on its own doesn't have a brilliant taste characteristic, but then these are medicinal herbs and they are authentic. So we're not adding flavour to modify in any way. We're making sure the authenticity is protected. So what we have done is we have added clove and not just any clove, Sri Lankan authentic artisanal clove combined with peppermint So together what we offer in Arana is a line that presents authenticity that is perfectly aligned with what we hearing from the market Consumers are talking about sugar-free, they're talking about plant-based, they're talking about caffeine-free and they're talking about goodness, consumption, consuming goodness but also they're talking about ethics and here you have the perfect representation of a line of infusions that have a story that is as old as 3,000 years that also represent that combination of taste, goodness and ethical purpose. Where ethical purpose is concerned I think you all know that my father, Mariel Fernando, made a commitment to making his business a matter of human service and that's a commitment that my family, my colleagues and I, we honor without compromise and in Arana we present the same a collection of ingredients crafted by Ayurvedic physicians artisanally harvested tasted produced in the most stringent hygienic conditions to present our customer herbal teas and infusions that are rich with natural goodness and the assurance of taste, goodness and purpose. Please do try it.",Success,

How to Make Tea Infused Salmon Gravlax,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8EVPrshI_A," Hi, I'm Peter Karavita and I'm going to make some beautiful tea infused Gravlax. Now Gravlax is a Swedish dish, it's salmon which is cured with dill, sugar and salt. It's such a wonderful dish, it comes up firm and juicy but with the addition of tea it makes it very unique. Flavors of the tea which I'm using today, which is Dilma's English breakfast, just settle on your tongue and actually add another depth and flavour to this beautiful classic dish. So it's very simple. I think a couple of ingredients is always the easiest way to go. With a mandoline or a very sharp knife, take some fennel and shape it really thinly. It's important that it's thin. It's got quite a strong anise flavour. So, you know, you don't need too much, but it also has a wonderful flavor. If you've never had it before, go and try it because it's wonderful. Now, some green apples. Green apple adds a tang, but it also will add acidity and a beautiful crunch. An apple goes really well with all the ingredients we're working with here. Now, that little salad is going to be enhanced with some Dilma's English breakfast tea, some dill, which is just roughly torn, as well as the tops of the fennel. Don't throw the fennel tops away. They're so wonderful and tasty. Now, to make a dressing for that, really simple. It seeded mustard some bees honey unflavoured preferably You don want too many flavours in there Now I not using any salt or pepper in this because there salt in the fish so you don need to add too much And a little bit of lime, that sort of helps to cut through it all. The lime juice is always a great way to add some lighters on, as I say. Now, that dressing will go on top of the salad and gently toss the salad and let it sit. Sitting will help all the flavours combine. We'll also allow the tea to infuse into there. And now we'll just slice the salmon. You can see it looks quite dark. Looks really dark. But wait till I cut it. The beautiful vibrant orange of the salmon comes through. Use a really nice sharp knife and try and get beautiful thin slices. You don't want it too thick. Otherwise people are maybe not going to appreciate it as much as you'd like. four or five slices you could do this on a platter and then you look inside look at that it's still beautiful glimmering now get yourself a serving platter and place the salad nicely scattered on top and just arrange your fish on top and this needs nothing else i'm telling you this would be a wonderful snack for summer. If you want to you could turn that into canapes and it just shows you it's another thing that you can do with Dilma's amazing tea. It is fantastic to drink but also if you think a little bit sideways you're going to be able to cook with them as well. So enjoy this recipe try and do it it's simple.",Success,"Peter Karavita demonstrates a tea‑infused gravlax, a Swedish cured salmon dish prepared with dill, sugar, and salt and flavored with Dilma’s English Breakfast tea. He pairs the gravlax with a thin‑sliced fennel and green‑apple salad dressed in a mixture of seeded mustard, unflavoured bee’s honey, lime juice, and the same tea, omitting additional salt or pepper. The salmon is sliced thinly and arranged on a platter atop the salad, creating a snack suitable for summer or canapés. All ingredients are combined to let the tea infuse and the flavors meld before serving."
How to Make Rose with French Vanilla Tea Turkish Delight,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9m2MDU_5IY," Peter Kurovedi here with a delicious dessert. This came to me as soon as I saw this beautiful tea. Rose with French Vanilla from Dilma is available everywhere. It is such an aromatic and wonderful tea but as soon as I tried it I just thought dessert dessert dessert. I'm making rose with French vanilla Turkish delight so again when using tea what we're doing is where we're replacing tea with a normal ingredient and this time it's rose water so I need to bring this to 121 degrees it's sugar and water and that comes to a softball and then I add the rest it's getting close to 121 So what I need to do now is to ensure that my gelatin has been soaked for at least five minutes. And then you can just move it around and I have all my other things ready. Rose and French vanilla tea as well as my corn flour and some red colouring So now it reached 121 degrees you turn the flame off immediately It won heat anymore And if it cools down a little bit, that's not a bad thing. Next, take the gelatin, squeeze out as much water as you can and place it into the sugar mixture. Stir that through until it dissolves. Make sure there's no pieces of gelatin left, you can see how it's. So then some rose with French vanilla tea, which is going to replace the rose water. Thorn flour goes in. And this is the basics of Turkish delight. Obviously it has to set. So again, we're just stirring it through. The tea's brewing all the way. Red colouring. Get that vibrant pink. A little bit more if you want it a little bit redder. Now, the container here which has been greased It also has some glad wrap on it or plastic wrap Again it important that this sugar cools down under 100 degrees otherwise as soon as you pour it on it will just melt. You just pour it in and let it set. Now you've seen the method of how to make Turkish delight Turkish delight came to your mind straight away because it has rose water in it so I thought why not substitute the rose water for Dilma's rose with french vanilla tea so this is set hopefully hard it looks delicious look at the vibrant red color it is and you just have to peel it off the plastic and then cut it up. What I'm going to do is two things. First, now this is a good lesson right here, to ensure that you grease your mould really well. Now I have, but it still sticks, so make sure you do, otherwise all this effort is going to be wasted. But you don't want to put too much oil on it either. You saw on the bottom I put icing sugar Now there an icing sugar you can buy called non It basically a mixture of icing sugar Now my little jelly is beautiful I'm going to do two things. The traditional Turkish delight is just dusted in icing sugar. So I have a nice bit of icing sugar here but I also love Turkish delight which is dipped in chocolate and that's just ready to go. That can be a sweet that you give to people you can wrap it nicely or it can just sit there so that you can nibble away whenever you feel like it. The next is to dip them into chocolate. So for that I've tempered the chocolate as I said and giving it a little stir, placing it on my bowl. I've got some hot water there which keeps it at the right temperature. Don't leave it in the chocolate too long remember you've got gelatin so therefore the gelatin will melt if you do leave it in too long but chocolate is going to set on this and we're going to have some delicious Dilma rose with french vanilla Turkish delight so enjoy it do try it and have it with a cup of Dilma rose with french vanilla tea",Success,"Peter Kurovedi demonstrates a recipe for Turkish delight that substitutes Dilma’s Rose with French Vanilla tea for traditional rose water, heating a sugar‑water mixture to 121 °C before removing the heat and allowing it to cool below 100 °C. After soaking gelatin for at least five minutes and squeezing out excess water, the gelatin is incorporated into the hot sugar mixture, followed by corn flour, red food colouring, and the brewed tea, then poured into a well‑greased, plastic‑wrapped mould to set. Once firm, the confection is cut, dusted with a mixture of icing sugar, and optionally dipped in tempered chocolate kept at a stable temperature using a hot‑water bath. The final product is a pink‑coloured, tea‑infused Turkish delight that can be served with a cup of Dilma Rose with French Vanilla tea."
How to Make a Green Tea infused Pickle for Seafood,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7LGA-BWoV4," Hi I'm Peter Kurovita and I'm going to show you how to use tea in food. I've been doing it all day actually so I hope you've been enjoying it but today I want to think about using seafood and green tea. In my eyes green tea and seafood go hand in hand. They're the perfect partners and that's what Dilma is all about making perfect tea that pairs matches or infuses with beautiful food. The tea I'm actually using is my favorite of all. Dilma's green tea with jasmine flowers. It is stunning. The aroma, flavors, and also the cleansing, healthy aspects of green tea have to always be thought about because that is an amazing part of it. Now, without talking anymore, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. Here comes a kingfish. It's the Wagyu of the sea in my eyes. It's a beautiful kingfish that comes from South Australia. is marbled with fat and perfect for sashimi. So to prepare it, I'm just going to remove the skin, trying to stay as close to the fat as possible because the fat aspect of it is so important. What's left on the bottom of the skin on the actual meat is the good fats It delicious very good for you and also not wasteful So try not to waste any at all Look on the back you see all that beautiful fat as well and just place it aside for a second. What we have to do now is to actually make the vinaigrette. To do that I've got the tea and I have, it's a pickle really, so think about ginger, pickled ginger going with sashimi that's where our head is at the moment i have two teaspoons of dillmar's green tea with jasmine which will be put into a container that has rice vinegar a little bit of sugar and a little pinch of salt and it's slightly warmer just cooked it for a few seconds on the stove till everything dissolves and then putting the tea leaves in there will actually be a brew but an acidy, whoa, that flavour, an acidy flavoursome brew that will go perfectly with kingfish. What we're gonna pickle, and we're going to pickle a cucumber because cucumber's fresh and light, zingy, crunchy, all of those things that you want when you've got a piece of fish. What I'm doing is I'm peeling it alternately so that you have some nice stripes down the cucumber Chop the top off And then using a really fine mandolin or again a knife just quickly slice them so that you end up with beautiful thin slices of cucumber. Now this pickle will keep so if you don't use it all for this which I'm obviously not going to but I've got so much here you can actually put it into a jar or a bag and put it away and keep it for later use. Now with the pickling liquid slightly warm, it's not hot, I'm going to place it over the cucumber and just let it mix through and that will slowly brew. The cucumber, there's a couple of things you can do. I have the salt inside the pickle so I didn't salt the cucumber but if you wanted to you can salt the cucumber and then squeeze it out, rinse it, and it goes a little bit limper. But like this, it's absolutely fine as well. Now to prepare the fish, get yourself a really nice plate. And what we're going to do, I'm going to cut through the bloodline, keep this piece, and just cut some not too thick, but not too thin slices. Just a nice two bites And when you cut through try and keep it all even make it look really nice A sharp knife is the only way to go when you cutting sashimi because otherwise you will end up with a big mess. And then the fish can be just arranged on the plate. And if this is going to be eaten just like this, so just the pickles and the fish, let's think about a few other little things, maybe a little wedge of lime. Add just a little bit of color onto the fish and give it another dimension. The longer it waits, the softer it will get. And the flavor of the tea is in, And don't be scared about eating tea leaves. It's good for you. It's a herb. So think about it like you're eating a health-giving, beautiful herb with your sashimi. And that to me, as a dish, as a salad, as a side, you know, is all you need. Serve it with some chopsticks. Go and find somewhere peaceful. Make yourself a cup of green tea and enjoy this dish. Thank you.",Success,"Peter Kurovita demonstrates a recipe that pairs Dilma’s green tea with jasmine and a South Australian kingfish, which he describes as “the Wagyu of the sea,” prepared as sashimi‑style slices. He creates a warm vinaigrette by dissolving rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, then adding two teaspoons of the tea leaves to form an acidic brew that is poured over thinly sliced cucumber for quick pickling. The fish is arranged on a plate with the pickled cucumber, a wedge of lime for color, and the tea leaves may be eaten alongside the sashimi. The dish is intended to be served with chopsticks and accompanied by a cup of green tea."
How to Cold Brew Tea: Mai Tai Tea Cocktail Recipe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouAgVlxTBiM," Hi, I'm Peter Kouravita and I'm going to show you a whole lot of amazing things you can do with Dil Marti. This is not drinking it, but this is infusing it and putting it into other things. And the first I'm going to start off with a cocktail. So a Mai Tai is a tropical drink and it's normally topped with an almond liqueur, which is, you know, amaretto or something like that. Now what I can show you is how to cold infuse alcohol with tea. Amaretto is almond right so Dilma's Italian almond tea is perfect for this. We add some rum to a few tea bags and we let it steep for 45 minutes and in that time the cold infusion will get so strong that all the flavour and the texture from the tea will come out into this liquor. While that's being made we can build the drink. So start off with a nice glass, a teaspoon of grenadine and then fill the glass with ice. So next we're going to put an orange liqueur, 30 mils and be gentle as you pour it in so that that you just basically layer it. You don't want to upset the grenadine. Next a full shot of white rug of your choice whatever you like You can see that the red is still staying very close to it And then two shots of pineapple juice. And this is the tropical side of it. 90ml. So, and then we top it off with our cold brewed 45 minute rum. rum which is now smelling and tasting like amaretto or almond liqueur. It's a pretty simple drink, looks great layered and then we can garnish it with maybe some dehydrated pineapple, a slice of lime, a little umbrella for the tropics and just a little bit more ice. There we have a Dilma cold brewed Mai Tai and I use the cold brew using Italian almond tea. Really simple, delicious, fresh, light and when your guest gets it they can stir it all up and end up with this very beautiful tropical drink. So here's cheese from Dilma. And as Meryl from J Fernando says, do try it.",Success,"Peter Kouravita demonstrates a cold‑infusion technique using Dilma’s Italian almond tea, steeping rum with tea bags for 45 minutes to create an almond‑flavored spirit.

We're going to be tasting three teas that are upcoming and they are spectacular but before I declare them spectacular I need to have your opinion. So now what we are doing is we're going to offer each of us a little tasting let's have a look we have here this beautiful tea just north of Norelia and it's from our Emerald Hills tea garden Robert you have plenty there great so what I'm gonna ask you to do is slurp you know how to do it so you see the lightness in the cup and you see the see the aroma very oceanic vegetal but still bright still a little bit of citrus in the finish and very different to a typical Chinese green tea because this is made by us using the broader leaf Assamica variant what do you think Peter culinary wise, fresh, vibrant, lychee maybe there's like an amazing fruity aroma to it. Unique for its elevation, it's a beautiful tea. And a great finish, clean really really clean which is fantastic. And how would you cheese with this Petit? Oh I'd go for maybe even a Corgonzola style because this is something really green like in spinach. So I'm thinking of the bridge to spinach, what would I do? But it could also do with a very good burrata. I think it's very subtle so it's a very exciting tea. I'm longing to get to my counter and pair it. Would we rinse what you do? Yeah, we might with this one. Wonderful and Edwin, what do you think? Well I love the polyphenols. It's light and yet it's still very present and I think with tea it's the polyphenols that also enable you to do pairings with food especially when you have polyphenols and tangents there it cuts through some of the oil or some of the creaminess in food so it goes very well with not only with desserts but lots of savory food. And now the bad boy Robert what would you do with spirits and this beautiful tea? Because it's such a special tea the first thing that comes to mind is not mixing it but pairing it and I can think of quite a few very nice Blanco tequila's and sip one after the other. The fruity note as well it has a floral touch to it like most good tequila's have as well and I think both will boost each other. The texture there's a nice texture to it isn't it that slight oiliness it's it's nearly a center but it's not quite it's brighter because of the astringency of the salon green teas is there something you feel it's got more body and then essentially makes a bigger impression the same shows like anyone's friend and this is someone's best friend okay now when you all have finished drinking the tea I'm gonna take this and ferment it and once you ferment it for about two months mix it with sesame oil pineapple juice and different things like kimchi I turn it into kimchi and you can add it to your salads and it becomes really good for your gut health And because the camellia isn really good for eating when you ferment it it breaks the leaves down and then it becomes an amazing additive so just think kimchi two and a half thousand years ago the burmese were doing this with all their green tea um and we've started doing it now so don't throw your tea away people i'll take it and make something with it as long as you don't smoke it peter you can have it all you need to grow something different for that deal So that was the Emerald Hills Anniversary OP. It's a beautiful tea and you know we make this green tea using the orthodox method. So you have the typical eyebrow curl, you have quite a dark green. It is typical of a high-grown Ceylon green tea. So very unique and very different to the Chinese method. And now we are going to try our celebration peko which which comes from Craighead Estate. Craighead is a mid elevation estate. And Robert. So here you have something completely different. You can almost smell as you would say, Edwin, the polyphenols or in wine speak the tannins. I love the colour. It's just amazing. So you can see here it's quite bright but it's a little dark because it's a malty tea. It's a mid elevation tea so it's been exposed to a fair amount of heat and sunlight. But it's in this typical shorty peco appearance which, so completely different aromas. Lovely, some woody accents there too. And a little bit of seaweed accents. Much more fruity, more stewed maybe. It's more body down there. There's more body compared to the other two. Some intensity, yet it's elegant. Yet it's still quite smooth. Yeah, quite smooth. I like Betty, your mention of seaweed. Kelp based food is another big thing that's coming in and you can easily match that with kelp easily. Yeah. And it's got the colour again, I'll say the colour again, but it is beautiful. It looks like a scotch actually, doesn't it? It does. Stunning. But yes, I think with this, kelp-based. So thinking around that, I haven't really got anything concrete I can give you now. But if I think kelp and then go into kelp-based foods and salads, that's where I'd go with this. So this estate is around an hour from Kandy. And so it comes in as a mid-elevation. But, reasonable brightness, some fruit, different types of different fruit than in the case of the green tea. Robert, what would you do with this? Whiskey, definitely. A seaside whiskey where you have this touch of the ocean that would connect beautifully with this whiskey. Talisker or something. Exactly, Talisker. I love Talisker and whiskey is always a good idea. Specifically Talisker where you have these notes from the sea that come back in the spirit. They're going to form like a natural marriage with notes in the tea. a great old-fashioned. Now you're talking my language. That's what I was hoping for. This is really a perfect match. Edwin, what do you think? I like it because I think it very versatile You could go with seafood you could also go with white meats and if you could push it to work with red meats as well with some heavier sauces Although when you do that the tea takes the secondary role but that fine too Sometimes one has to take the lead How would you cheese with it? A sheep with it. A sheep with it. Like a good manchego, not too old, or one of our sheep cheeses from the Isles. because I think it can go with the sheep always has a high percentage of fat and I think it'll break down the fats and just blend together. Looks fabulous to me. Any advice, Peter, on how would you use this? Oh, how to use it? Well, Edwin, you're talking about, you know, pairing it. I was thinking too, it would make an amazing consomme. You know, you've got those earthy, light sort of notes to it and you wouldn't have to do much to that to have, say, I mean, even if you went something like a venison stock, and then you clarified the stock with the tea mixed into the egg whites, that that flavor sort of rolls through each of them, and it'll clarify and become the same color, probably become a bit deeper, so color-wise it'd be incredible, and you could have a broth, a bone broth, that looks like that, that not only has the health incentives of the bones, which is now all the grays as well, but also have the benefits of tea and again the colour I love it. Fantastic thank you. So on our journey today we have come from Norelia because Emerald Hills is a little north of Norelia 6,000 feet above sea level we've come across to Craighead Estate and that's where we've got this beautiful peco now we're coming to another peco on an estate that is on the way to Gaul quite close to Gaul called Endane Estate and this is our Sapphire Peco Sapphire because these three teas and in particular this one they celebrate my father's 70 years in tea which also coincides with his 90th birthday so it's it's these are all very special teas and which is why i'm especially honored that you joined us at this tasting can i have two spoons of this one you may indeed that's When you said gall, I was... Oh, I know, you like gall. It goes well with your spirits. I'm going to give Edwin a double helping too. And Robert, would you mind just checking out the infusion there? So you see it's a darker infusion because it's more sunshine, more humidity, sandy soils, very different terroir. So what do you think, lady and gentleman? Very similar in terms of colour, little more intensity, but very similar to the Celebration Peko. Given the elevation, I was expecting it to have really tough tenons, but actually it's so smooth, it's so smooth and yet it still stays true to lower grown tea character. So it has the best of both worlds. This is exactly what, because when you said gold, one of my favorite teas is an orange peco, a gold orange peco. And this is the same style, so full of character but at the same time so much subtleness. You get these notes of ripe sometimes overripe fruit And this is there so many things I can do with this tea because it has a lot of body so there a lot to work with Whether it is from a light spirit to a dark spirit, first thing that comes to mind to me is rum. Because of the sweetness you find in rum, that would just perfectly complement this tea. Although in all honesty this is the tea that I would just rather drink like this because this is I agree 100% I wouldn't mess with this tea I would just drink it with anything it really is beautiful you know what we did we had five months of rainfall and we were trying to get something right for my father's 70th anniversary in tea it wasn't happening because with rain you can't make really good tea you need a balance and so in In December, the rain stopped on Christmas Day. We gave the plants two weeks to be conditioned and it went from rainfall to intense heat, almost drought conditions. So it was perfect, which is why we have this unique characteristic. We also went for this peco style and that's what gives it the softness and doesn't give you too many of the caramelly notes, but you have that soft elegance. But in terms of pairing, would it work well, do you think, Edwin, with chocolate? Yeah, we'll work with chocolate, we'll work with meats, we'll work with white meats as well. But I can't help but going back to what you said about the season, because it really reminds me of the wine industry, where they might have a lot of rain and in the last few weeks they might have a lot of sunshine and then everything ripens and then concentrates the flavours and then actually you have something even better than what you would have expected. For all three of these, they were all made in the second week of January. That's meant to be. Yeah, absolutely. And what would you do with this, Betty? I'd go for a rindwashed cheese, a bit of aromatic cheese to get the aromas more enhanced by the tea. A little bit of sweetness in the cheese, because to me it's got some dry walnut feeling in your mouth, and that goes very well with sweetness in a rich cheese. So yeah, this is something to put a fireplace on, have a chunk of the rindwashed cheese and a glass of this and be happy. And what Peter said about the first tea, when you're done with this one, please give me the leaves because I think I can make a beautiful infusion with this as well. I would go for that from gins, tequilas, all the way to even quite a robust whiskey, even bourbon I would just slowly infuse them on a low low temperature check them daily and you I can get those notes to complement any spirit I can find this is a really would be a great finishing touch for for spirit infusion I would sit on a deck with my sarong on and the wind blowing up my sarong while looking out at yala looking out at yala sipping this tea and eating a spicy beef curry to me i think that would just be perfect beef curry with the spices and everything and this tea they wouldn't cancel each other out i think that worked well together yeah don't worry about the sarong but you have to build the story beautiful thank you very much thank you robert sinker thank Thank you, Edwin. Thank you, Betty. And thank you, Peter. Pleasure. Thank you. Let's enjoy these teas. Thank you.",Success,

Episode 05: MasterChef Australia Finalist Simon: what’s in your cup of tea? | Sustainability,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6fdg0DDAU," Good ingredients are at the heart of every dish and their quality and sustainability are important to every chef. Sustainability is part of my life and my cooking and it's also a part of my tea time. When I travelled to Sri Lanka a few years ago I discovered that Dilma tea hasn't just got freshness, flavour and plenty of antioxidants. Beyond all the good stuff there's more. Sustainably handcrafted to benefit people and the planet. This cup right here is delicious and it's also ethical. Merrill, whom you may know as Mr. Dilma and his family have always chosen and kindness as a business philosophy, both to nature and to the community. Profits from Dilma fund projects that help farmers adapt to climate change, rewild tea gardens, nature corridors to project species and strengthen sensitive ecosystems and restore wetlands. They have planted over a million trees, combining livelihoods with biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Now halfway through their second million while establishing green energy sources. You wouldn't think it, but I'm talking about what a family of tea growers do. None of it has much to do with tea, but everything to do with their values of taste, goodness and purpose. Now this will blow your mind. They have several climate change mangrove and environmental research stations with more on the way. Their biochar and the project help farmers who are struggling to adapt to the rapidly changing climate. Now that's sustainability, tea. Bad pun intended. There's freshness and goodness, obviously, but it's also a tea that gives back to people and the planet. What's in my cup of tea? A green tea that is green in every single way. And from what I hear, carbon negative by the year 2030. Cheers to that.",Success,"Dilma tea, produced by Merrill “Mr. Dilma” and his family in Sri Lanka, emphasizes sustainability through a business philosophy of kindness to nature and community.

What Dilma does with its profits has nothing to do with tea. If you drink Dilma tea you have the right to know where your money is going. Lucky it's written in small print on the side of the packet. But I went down to the Dilma tea gardens and saw it for myself. This is an ethical tea company in Sri Lanka run by Meron the Boys, a family of tea growers. They don't use business to make profits, they use business to make a difference. And with a part of that money they make from selling delicious tea, they do some amazing humanitarian and conservation work.

Episode 03:MasterChef Australia Finalist Simon: what’s in your cup of tea?|Passion of the Tea Grower,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZQMMAcGfLs," There is a story behind this cup of tea. And because it's no ordinary tea, it's no ordinary story. It all begins with a boy who was born in rural Sri Lankan village in 1930, where Sri Lanka was called Ceylon. His name was Merrill and he wanted to be a lawyer. One day he visited a friend's tea garden and for the first time saw how tea was made, met the tea pickers and the tea makers. he marveled at the commitment of how Ceylon tea is made. That kindled a lifetime of devotion to the wonderful herb. Ceylon was a British colony back then and Ceylonese weren't permitted to learn tasting. It was nothing short of a miracle, therefore, that in his 20s, Merrill was invited to join the first group of six to be allowed to learn tea. He boarded a ship and travelled to London. He was guided to see his beloved Ceylon tea being mixed from elsewhere, yet sold as Ceylon tea. Blended and mixed with other cheaper but inferior tea, the stuff they sold as Ceylon tea gave the big companies that dominated tea a bigger profit. The mixture was sold as Ceylon tea, even to us Aussies. What really upset the young man was discovering the profits that they made from selling Ceylon tea never reached Ceylon Merrill returned to Sri Lanka determined to fight the commoditization that he saw He would make his own tea and it would be handcrafted single origin and unblended It would be hand traditionally made from the highest quality. He would ensure its natural goodness and it is his tea that would be offered with his commitment to sharing his profits with the poor and caring for the workers and the environment. It was a dream that none had dared to dream. Much like the little David facing the giant Goliath, there followed years of struggle against overwhelming odds. His dream was nearly lost, yet 38 years later Dilma was finally born in 1988. Us Aussies were Merrill's first customers. Proving that where passion and purpose meet, success is assured. It was the first time that a native tea grower from any tea producing country had succeeded in launching a genuinely ethical farmer owned brand and we gave Merrill his first break. Merrill devoted 70 years of his life to tea to bring his tea to you. As he did so he changed the world of tea, a fair deal for producers and fresher better tea for tea drinkers. What's in my cup of tea? The passion of a tea grower for starters and plenty of taste, goodness and purpose that Meryl promised when he started out 70 years ago.",Success,"Merrill was born in a rural Sri Lankan village in 1930, when the island was known as Ceylon, and became interested in tea after visiting a local tea garden. In his twenties he joined the first group of six Ceylonese permitted to train in tea tasting in London, where he learned that exported “Ceylon tea” was frequently blended with lower‑quality teas and that profits did not"
Episode 02: MasterChef Australia Finalist Simon: what’s in your cup of tea? | Purity,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0OEwnM8OOE," What's in my cup of tea? Well, it's goodness for sure. But I didn't know that until I went to Sri Lanka and actually visited the beautiful tea gardens that belong to Dilma. I met the tea pickers there, only picking the top two tender leaves and bud. Because that's precisely what's needed to make a good cup of tea. But hey, a good cup of tea is not easy to make. See, first you need people to hand-pick 30 of the tender leaves and bud for each cup of good tea. It's a lot cheaper to use a machine, but they also pick the branches and older bitter leaves too. Second, to make a good cup of tea, and this is important, you have to pack your tea right where it's made. If you don't pick, perfect and pack the tea right where it's grown, it's not gonna be fresh. It's like baking cookies and leaving them on a plate for days instead of putting them in an airtight container. Packing tea right where it's grown seals in the flavour and antioxidants. And so what is freshness and antioxidants? Well that is the actual goodness and taste in tea. And that's why so many Aussies like myself love Dilma tea. Feels like I'm back in the Dilma tea gardens. What's in my cup of tea? Well, if you're talking about this one, it's freshness and purity single origin tea packed garden fresh.",Success,"The speaker visited the Dilma tea gardens in Sri Lanka, where pickers hand‑pick only the top two tender leaves and bud. Production of a cup of high‑quality tea requires about 30 of these tender leaves, whereas machine harvesting also collects older, bitter leaves. Dilma packs the tea immediately at the garden, preserving freshness, flavor and antioxidants by sealing it at the point of origin. The resulting single‑origin, garden‑fresh tea is popular among Australian consumers."

Tease your taste buds to a whole new dimension of Tea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS5KjYPvq4g," Edwin, it's been nearly 20 years that we've been associated. I want to start by first thanking you for that. Well I think the thanks should come from me because to be associated with the Dilma group and all the charitable work your father and yourself have been doing. Thank you but you know we started out many years ago in context of your expertise in wine on the introduction of our mutual friend Dorothy Tan and it has been a long journey in tea so we kind of grabbed you and took you away from your core expertise and passion in that journey tell me something about tea that might have impressed you probably the first thing about what I discovered was that tea is not just a beverage because One of the first tastings I did was with your father and he showed me that tea is responsive to terroir And if you recall I think one of the first projects was the water tea and i was surprised that you have highland tea midland grown tea low-grown tea and they all tasted so different i remember that but then you also went on to do a spectacular publication that we still use the Dilma way of tea yes well although you think it spectacular. It was a bit selfish of me because I wanted to learn more about tea and the best way was to research tea and the more I researched the more excited I got about tea and together with that the more excited I was about what Dilma was doing with tea unlike other tea companies. Do you like personally your preference is it for light tea, medium, strong or a variety? A variety of teas I mean as you said yourself there's a tea for every occasion and it's true some days you like a lighter tea some days I go for a highland tea or lowland tea and then besides that you go for the different styles of tea there the oolong tea and the white tea and then you know the dark teas and then now you got teas mixed in with other flavours as well and with other herbs which I mean it an unending world of taste So in your association as a key member of the faculty of the School of Tea and I must add that we could never have developed the School of Tea to this extent without you. You have been involved in looking at the history of tea, of sensory analysis, of pairing and so on. Is there any one aspect of tea that you particularly enjoy? I think it's that tea shouldn't be too serious, it should be fun. It should be fun and with the school of tea I think you've managed to make it a fun event where learning is fun, tea is not a serious product although there are benefits, serious benefits from drinking tea and enjoying tea and the culture of tea how tea began the politics of tea everything from the planting to growing the health benefits of tea and of course tea gastronomy So as you move into a different area of work in your family office which is the tea that you'll be taking in the morning and which in the afternoon and which in the evening? My favourite tea has always been the breakfast tea, but occasionally I'll steer towards St Earl Grey, but it's always breakfast tea. That's the first tea that comes to mind. That's fantastic. Because I can have it with or without milk. So we have our 70th anniversary of my father's 17th anniversary in tea as you know. So there are three special teas that will mark that occasion and we will present those to you to enjoy in your, you could say your hopefully temporary absence from tea. But Edwin, I want to add that without you a lot of what we have done here would not be possible. you that you brought the scientific, the practical, the sensory perspective to a lot of what we do.

Conserving Sri Lanka's Mangrove Forests,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJTJ-nUrCHU," Conserving blue carbon ecosystems like seagrass, mangroves and marshlands is important because they store three times more carbon than forest and land ecosystems. They also provide jobs and income to local economies, improve water quality, support healthy fisheries and provide coastal protection. However, it is estimated that half of the global mangrove cover has disappeared in the last 40 years. Did you know Sri Lanka was designated as the Global Mangrove Champion under the Commonwealth Blue Charter? Over the next decade, Dilma Conservation will commit to restow and conserve over 24 acres of degraded mangrove forest in Sri Lanka. We are collaborating with governmental organizations, local communities, educational institutes and other corporates. corporates. We aim to create a replicable model which will restore mangrove and shallow marine ecosystems with socio-economic development by the year 2030.

MasterChef Australia Finalist Simon: what’s in your cup of tea? | Handcrafted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQU2vWc_dz4," What's in my cup of tea? Well, it's goodness for sure. But I didn't know that until I went to Sri Lanka and actually visited the beautiful tea gardens that belong to Dilma. I met the tea pickers there, only picking the top two tender leaves and bud. Because that's precisely what's needed to make a good cup of tea. But hey, a good cup of tea is not easy to make. See, first you need people to hand-pick 30 of the tender leaves and bud for each cup of good tea. It's a lot cheaper to use a machine, but they also pick the branches and older bitter leaves too. Second, to make a good cup of tea, and this is important, you have to pack your tea right where it's made. If you don't pick, perfect and pack the tea right where it's grown, it's not gonna be fresh. It's like baking cookies and leaving them on a plate for days instead of putting them in an airtight container. Packing tea right where it's grown seals in the flavour and antioxidants. And so what is freshness and antioxidants? Well that is the actual goodness and taste in tea. And that's why so many Aussies like myself love Dilma tea. Feels like I'm back in the Dilma tea gardens. What's in my cup of tea? Well, if you're talking about this one, it's freshness and purity single origin tea packed garden fresh.",Success,"The speaker visited tea gardens in Sri Lanka owned by the Dilma brand, where pickers hand‑pick only the top two tender leaves and bud, using about 30 such leaves per cup. Dilma emphasizes that the tea must be packed at the garden where it is grown to preserve freshness, flavor and antioxidant content, contrasting this with machine harvesting that also collects older, bitter leaves. Packing the tea immediately after harvest is presented as essential for maintaining its purity and single‑origin quality. The speaker notes that many Australians prefer Dilma tea for these attributes."

Tea in tune with what matters – a Dilmah story,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcvDKvHazRQ," The unique geographical heritage of Sri Lanka, its topology, climate and soil, makes it an ideal land where any crop can be grown. Dilma tea is made in the traditional artisanal manner, which requires meticulous care with a personal touch each step of the way. Each leaf that goes into Dilma tea is plucked by hand. The tea leaves are rolled to rupture the leaf cells and allow the cell sap to mix, starting the process of oxidisation. The rolled leaves are spread onto ceramic beds and left to ferment, where the unique flavours and quality of the tea is developed. The doors are passed through the dryer at a temperature of 90 to 95 degrees Celsius. Dilma tea is packed at source, preserving all its natural goodness. It is a business built on quality, authenticity, ethics and integrity. Dilma cares for your tea. From the nursery to your cup. Tea in tune with you. Tea in tune with what matters.",Success,"Sri Lanka’s diverse topography, climate, and soil support the cultivation of many crops, including the tea produced by Dilma.

The company emphasizes quality, authenticity, ethical practices, and integrity throughout production. All processing steps are performed locally, preserving the tea’s natural characteristics."
How to Brew the Perfect Chai,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BGowWIgNkk," We are at the Dilma School of Tea. Welcome back. Today we are going to talk about chai. What is a chai? It is a tea-based healthy Ayurvedic drink. And why is it healthy? Because tea has a beautiful and perfect marriage with different natural ingredients. Tea itself is of course natural because it is the naturally processed leaf of Camellia sinensis. Around a thousand years ago our royalty came up with the idea of delivering natural Ayurvedic health through this combination of tea and spices in our 6,000 year pharmacopoeia star anise, cardamom, cillons, cinnamon, nutmeg these are the medicines that they used in that time and it is these that form the basis of a chai right now I'm going to invite Ajit from the tea lounge by Dilma who's going show us how to brew a chai. Go for it Ajit. You've got to start with a good tea. When I say good tea I don't mean just Dilma. I mean tea that is brewed perfectly because chai is a combination of tea milk whether you use oat milk whether you use as we do in our Sri Lankan tradition whether you use condensed milk or another it simply a matter of taste And then you combine other ingredients So every time you combine some ingredient with tea, you take something away from the tea. So you need to make sure that to respect the tea that you brew it right. So what Ajith is doing right now is he's used fresh tea he's sealed it made sure that it stays fresh and he's added his freshly boiled water and he's gonna stir stirring is important so many of us forget of course in hospitality we are busy but we've got to find time to stir and then you need to cover why do you cover it because a lot of the goodness in tea the goodness the antioxidants are also related to flavor so the goodness and the taste they are volatile which means when you keep it open that beautiful aroma that you get it is also the aroma of the flavor and the goodness leaving so Ajit is now brewing his tea but he has one that he has brewed before so Ajit will get our prior brewed tea so we'll move this aside and so five minutes is the brew but to save time we have one that has already been brewed and we are going to use this instance a Ceylon cinnamon so for this cinnamon because cinnamon has that woody sweetness it is spicy but it is gentle It's got a wonderfully sweet woodiness which we are going to be bringing out. So it is for that reason that we've chosen our brilliant breakfast tea from the tea series. So now if we were doing a ginger or a different, a more intense combination, we would be using a tea that was stronger, possibly even a lower elevation tea. So like all good members of the school of tea, Ajit has one that has been prepared before and this is his tea. So we're doing it in the traditional method in the streets of Colombo and what we're seeing now is with the addition of the condensed milk, you're getting a beautiful reddish color of the tea with milk and that reddishness is important because that means that you've brewed your tea strong and bright, a minimum of five minutes. And now what Ajith is doing, he's added the cinnamon, Ceylon cinnamon because that's got the goodness and he pulling the tea to oxygenate it and when you oxygenate it it tastes better So this froth it a sign that he doing it right and finally once he done that he going to pour it into our chai mug you got the pieces of the cinnamon coming through so that your guest is going to see and feel and taste all of the goodness that's in there and you have this beautiful aesthetically pleasing chai it's authentic and it has that fantastic taste respecting the tea with the strong brew but the important thing about chai also is that you need to create your signature chai. You can use lemongrass, you can use ginger, you can use cinnamon or nutmeg, whatever or you can use pandan leaf that grows in your home or grows in your property. You can use local honey to sweeten and take away from this condensed milk. You can use oat milk, you can use almond milk but always make sure that the combination comes together harmoniously and when I say harmoniously I mean in aroma, in taste, in texture and in the personality. So here I've got a strong tea, I've got sweetness from the condensed milk being balanced out by the sweetness and the spice that comes from the Ceylon cinnamon. Thank you Ajit and cheers.",Success,"Chai is an Ayurvedic beverage made from Camellia sinensis tea combined with traditional spices such as star anise, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg, a practice attributed to royalty a thousand years ago within a 6,000‑year pharmacopoeia. At the Dilma School of Tea, Ajit from the Tea Lounge by Dilma demonstrates a standard preparation: sealed fresh tea is brewed with boiled water for five minutes, stirred, covered to retain volatile antioxidants, then mixed with condensed milk to achieve a reddish hue indicating a strong brew. Ceylon cinnamon is added and the mixture is oxygenated to produce froth before being poured into a chai mug, displaying visible cinnamon pieces. The method allows customization with alternative milks (oat, almond), sweeteners (local honey), and additional aromatics such as lemongrass, ginger, or pandan leaf,"
"One Plant, Many Teas",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5xkwbgPCp4," Welcome back! This is the Dilma School of Tea and we're talking tea. Now this is a black tea, something like our Dilma Premium Ceylon and what we do here, I'm going to taste these teas. This is a fully fermented tea, that's what a black tea is. It's hand-picked and it's hand-made according to a traditional method perfected over 5,000 years and what is different about this tea, looking at it in comparison with the others is that it has intensity it has brightness but it has intensity it is somewhat like a Shiraz in comparison to a Pinot Shiraz with much greater intensity the intensity comes from the influence of light of sunshine of course of the soils and that produces together with the humidity and other weather conditions it produces that intensity because these two come from the same plant in fact so do all of these except the influence of nature what we define as terroir that sense of place which combines climate soils the influence of heaven and earth it's that that makes this difference so here we're looking Looking at an oolong a dark oolong earthy doesn have the intensity and the robustness of our Ceylon black tea but it earthy and it midway between the black tea and our Ceylon green tea Unfermented, it's light, it's grassy, it's got hay notes, herbal notes and it's a completely different body. A little bit of sweetness in the finish but then here's a prince amongst teas. Now this Ceylon Silver Tips made on Craycate Estate, it is the bud only and the bud is the young tender bud. It is young and therefore contains the greatest amount of antioxidants and then it diminishes. So you have the first leaf with the next highest level of antioxidants, the second leaf and so on. And this is an extraordinary experience. it's got sweetness it's got notes of lychee it's got rambutan it's it's it's beautiful it's balanced clean and extremely bright light and bright on the palate and so these four teas what makes them different is of course to an extent the manufacturing method fermented lightly fermented unfermented and completely handmade but most critically importantly the essence of each of these teas is defined by nature that is terroir and it is the beauty in tea",Success,"The Dilma School of Tea presents four distinct Ceylon teas: a fully fermented black tea (Dilma Premium Ceylon) noted for high intensity and brightness, an earthy dark oolong positioned between black and green teas, an unfermented green tea with grassy, hay and herbal notes, and the Ceylon Silver Tips from Craycate Estate, a bud‑only tea rich in antioxidants and characterized by sweet lychee and rambutan flavors. All teas are hand‑picked and hand‑crafted using traditional methods that date back roughly 5,000 years. Their differing flavor profiles are attributed primarily to terroir—the combined effects of climate, soil, sunlight, humidity, and other natural conditions. Fermentation levels range from fully fermented (black) to lightly fermented (oolong) to unfermented (green) and non‑fermented bud tea (Silver Tips)."
How to Pair Tea with Food,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciRVIuE0VwY," Welcome back to the Dilma School of Tea. Now we're going to see what we can do with that extraordinary beauty of terroir that nature has blessed each of these teas with. Now we're working here with a Ceylon single region black tea, fully fermented. A Suncha Japanese style green tea. An Oolong which is lightly fermented. green tea unfermented of course and a white tea which is entirely handmade just the buds and made on our Craighead estate. And what are we doing with the food? A burger, something as simple as a burger. The meat is an extraordinary connection in terms of flavour, texture and functional benefit with the tea. Why is that? Because tea has a special functional aspect which is its ability to emulsify fats and its ability to balance sugars. And that is how tea works in your body in terms of offsetting the impact of cholesterol on the human body, helping the human body to combat diabetes and its myriad other human health benefits. And so what we're doing here is we are going beyond human health benefit. That's not possible, but we're going to try it. And that means bringing in that aspect of flavor So what the combination of this medium burger and this tea does is that it brings out the tea brings out the flavor of the burger brings out the meatiness in the burger. In this case you have sushi and what this sanchar, grassy, slightly herbal green tea, it's got some texture, it's a little bit of an oily texture and what that does is it brings out the texture and the character in the sushi. So in this case you have the a little bit of ginger and it enhances the flavor of the ginger, it enhances the flavor of the seaweed, the rice and so on. The toasted character in the rice particularly coming through and here you have an oolong and what this oolong does with this cheesecake is it enhances the texture, it brings out that creaminess and that is beautiful on the palate. And then you have our Ceylon Silver Tips which brings out the lemony note in this lemon meringue And the interesting thing is, once you have, once you eat the food, take a sip of the tea, beautiful pairing. Take the second sip, cleansed. It's a palate cleanser, extraordinary one, because it is natural. There is no interference of humans in this except to honor a 5,000 year tradition of handpicking, of withering, to concentrate the flavors, of rolling, and in the case of the black tea and the oolong fermentation light or full fermentation. Enjoy!",Success,"The Dilma School of Tea demonstrates pairings of several estate teas—including a fully fermented Ceylon single‑region black tea, Suncha Japanese‑style green tea, lightly fermented Oolong, unfermented green tea, and handmade white tea from the Craighead estate—with foods such as a beef burger, sushi, cheesecake, and lemon‑meringue. The presentation highlights tea’s functional properties, noting its ability to emulsify fats, balance sugars, and potentially mitigate cholesterol effects and diabetes‑related impacts. Each tea is described as enhancing specific sensory attributes of the paired dish: the black tea accentuates meatiness, the green tea amplifies sushi’s ginger, seaweed, and rice notes, the Oolong enriches cheesecake creaminess, and Ceylon Silver Tips bring out lemony flavors in the meringue. The process references a 5,000‑year tradition of hand‑picking, withering, rolling, and light or full fermentation to concentrate flavor."
Pairing Chocolate with Tea,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vF3U-kkVEs," Welcome back. This is the School of Tea. Today we are looking at some very simple, accessible and popular foods and we're trying to see how tea can dignify them. So here we have a Lindt hazelnut chocolate. It has that nutty sweetness that is characteristic of good chocolate but where it comes into its own is in combination with this Italian almond tea. a beautiful combination of hazelnut and almond but then the tea because it's a black tea it is fully fermented it has some bitterness in it extraordinarily balancing out the sweetness and cleansing the palate it's highlighting the chocolatey note but it's highlighting and then diminishing the sweetness which is what we all want because when you walk away from the table after eating something nice you want to feel good and feel your palate cleansed. So now we're going to again something very simple the Cadbury fruit and nut it's sweet milk chocolate. I think we all know what Cadbury chocolate tastes like. The combination with this mango and strawberry tea is fantastic. What it does the temperature melts the chocolate so it enhances the appreciation of the chocolate but then what it does the mango and the strawberry fuse brilliantly with the fruity note in the fruit and nut it enhances the characteristic the flavor and the appreciation of chocolate texture and flavor and then on the second sip completely cleanses the palette and leaves it with this beautiful clean bright tea character it's soft it's a wonderful lingering finish but you're also getting some of the chocolate still coming up a beautiful combination whether it's milk chocolate or whether it's a lint hazelnut so here we have something that is served in every hotel it's a red velvet cake and we'll try a little bit of this red velvet is sweet but it's that is a light savory sour note and so here in combination with our Craighead Oolong. This is a soft, lightly fruity tea. It's almost a sweet tea. Beautifully balances out the texture of the cake. It brings it up, enhances the cake, enhances it in texture and flavor, and then takes it all away. Not only washing away the fats by emulsifying the fats, but also washing away the sweetness. Cheers. you",Success,"The School of Tea demonstrates pairing Lindt hazelnut chocolate with an Italian almond black tea, noting that the tea’s bitterness balances the chocolate’s nutty sweetness and cleanses the palate.

It's a Sencha style green tea. It's light, it's grassy, it has herbaceous notes, a little bit citrusy and it's a perfect pairing for the seaweed in this sushi. So with sushi you have ingredients that would beautifully complement the character of this tea. Cucumber, you have seaweed itself and you have lightly toasted rice. And so in combination, you produce that extraordinary marriage of flavour. It's a harmonious, beautiful marriage. And then on the second sip, you find that taste, the flavour, the oiliness, all of that is completely washed away. What a beautiful pairing of tea and food.",Success,"The Dilma School of Tea presents a Sencha‑style green tea characterized by light, grassy, herbaceous and slightly citrusy notes.

Easy chicken salad with a tea vinaigrette – S01E03,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDOgqRQpab8," Today I'm using two teas in one dish. How's that? I'm going to use the beautiful chamomile flowers. Now this is stunning. I love to drink it, but I find tea and chamomile are a match made in heaven. And then one of the infusions. In this one, there's moringa, chili, cocoa and cardamom. Spices are great. Tea assists you to emulsify your food and therefore gives you great health. So what better way to be healthy than eat a great salad infused with Dilma tea? Let's get started. All right, so there's two parts to this dish. One is the chicken, which I'm going to coat with chamomile flowers, fried garlic, and some onion salt, and then fry and chill. The other side is actually the salad. These three things here, the soybeans, the cranberries, and the mixed nuts, were all in a package called a superfood salad. Strips of zucchini some heirloom tomatoes and snow peas and sugar snap peas and they going to make the salad I got some organic apple cider vinegar and I infused three bags into 150 ml overnight First I'm going to make the salt to go on the chicken. The aroma of these pure chamomile flowers, I just want to show you how beautiful they are. I don't know whether many people ever look into your bag of tea but I suggest you do with Dilma tea because the only thing in there are the pure ingredients that they say. Fried garlic and then the salt component will come from this onion salt. So just stick that in and then just give it a quick blend. So just liberally sprinkle this beautiful chamomile and garlic salt all over your chicken. Now what I need to do with this is actually to rest it and chill it. So once I've cooked it, then I'm going to put it in the fridge once it's cool and allow it to rest a little bit. Now the rest of this salt I'm going to keep because I'm going to sprinkle it on top of the chicken afterwards. The chicken will probably take you five to seven minutes. So what happened was that chicken breast was so thick I thought I put it in the oven it been in for about seven minutes and then pull it out It beautifully golden brown and cooked It cooked all the way through and now I basically need to put it away, let it chill, let all the flavors go in, and then I can make my salad. Now I'm going to add all the other ingredients to this salad, so some beautiful soybeans, mixed nuts, pepitas, cranberries, some sugar snap peas and snow peas, just crunchy. So when you cook them, you just boil some water, have some ice on the side, drop them in, wait about 25 seconds and take them out. This zucchini, which I think is crazy. I'm going to season that with some salt and pepper. And then a combination of this moringa chili coconut and cardamom vinegar the flavor will come through so well olive oil as you do in a in a vinaigrette and just a little bit of balsamic vinegar but this is reduced thick balsamic so it'll add some sweetness to it that just gets tossed around look at that just lots of colors lots of flavors put that aside for a second and now my chicken I need to slice I always say cut any kind of meat against the grain because then it's more tender. Put a little bit of the salad on the bottom. Wow, the flavours are so good. The flavours of the ginger and the chamomile are now coming through. Put this chicken on. chicken breast is enough for two. Some of that. Use a little bit of the salt to bring out all the flavors. And really that's a very simple salad using Dilma's chamomile tea but also Dilma's morunga, chilli, cocoa and cardamom and that has been infused into vinegar so healthy tasty delicious enjoy Thank you.",Success,"The recipe uses two Dilma tea blends: pure chamomile flowers for a garlic‑onion salt that coats chicken breast, and a moringa‑chili‑cocoa‑cardamom infusion prepared by steeping three tea bags in 150 ml apple cider vinegar overnight.

How to make vegan stew with a herbal infusion tea – S01E13,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PndKG8OQ-s," Music This one is going to be using mixed beans. I know for a fact that in the areas that I'm in, all of these beans have been sold out. So I'm sure a lot of you have these stuck in your cupboards and you don't know what to do. easy dish and I'm gonna get a help today too. My son Jai is just hanging around. Jai, Jai, come in. I'm gonna teach him how to do this. He's a uni student and uni students normally eat badly, even for a chef's son. So thanks Jai. Okay, so we've got a whole range of ingredients, very easy. Cumin seeds, dill seeds, garam masala, dried chilies from our garden, some fenugreek seeds, black sesame seeds, turmeric, salt, curry leaves. But one of the other ingredients is this tea. Cinnamon, turmeric, ginger and nutmeg. You think about that and you think yeah that's just food, a food tea. And the tea itself is rooibos, not camellia sinensis. So it has no caffeine but also you can ingest it much easier So great thing to cook with Start off with some coconut oil Here you go Jai Thank you Get the pan nice and hot Put your coconut oil in and then we'll just add everything. There's not even any onions in this. It's such a simple dish. So first what we need to do, Jai, is toast all the seeds. So you can add the cumin seed first. That's it. Dill seeds, dried chilies, fenugreek seeds, sesame, curry leaves. just scrape them in and break them in half. So when you gather them all on your hand, just break them, that's it, and just tear them in half. Now toast all of those. With a lot of these seeds, especially the fenugreek, if they burn, it's not gonna be very tasty at all. It actually goes bitter, so you have to be really careful. Now the other thing I got is some tofu. This is just spiced tofu, again, from the supermarket. Just toss it around. some turmeric and I've got some garam masala but that's right at the end I'm going to add that because it adds a really nice flavor and it's good if it's fresh but the other herb that I going to infuse is this beautiful dill marty check that out you can see the turmeric you see the ginger nutmeg the smell of it there and a beautiful colour there So sprinkle that in Let cook that through a little bit and then the hardest part of all, opening a can. You'll be used to this right. Don't drain them either. Like I really think it's the flavour of the beans. The beans are cooked inside the tin basically and so all this juice it's thick and juicy and has all the flavors of the actual beans itself. Add those two in please Jai. For everyone out there who is dairy free gluten free and vegan this is perfect but for you Jai you can put a couple bits of chicken in there if you like. So we just wait a few minutes probably about five or ten until it starts to bubble and boil then we'll taste it, season it and it's done. Good job. Thank you. Okay, Jai's gone, left me with it but the rest is easy. You can see that the sauce from this is thickened and that's all the juices from the can. And lastly, don't forget the garam masala It adds that beautiful flavour right at the end and the smell has everything It definitely 100 has all the things in this tea The cinnamon the turmeric the ginger and the nutmeg come through immediately But all the other spices that I put in, all the seeds, also add to the flavour. Try and get a little bit of everything in there. Into your bowl. Now I think with this, just a little bit of leftover bread, torn up, stuck on the side. and that is a really hearty, beautiful, warmer of a dish. Ensure that you have lots of health and vitality by drinking this tea and all those Ayurvedic herbs in there. And as a clean, vegetarian and vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free dish, you couldn't get much better. If you want gluten-free 100%, don't use the bread. But otherwise, hope you enjoy it. Cup of tea, a bowl of stew, a good movie. What else can you ask for when you're locked out? Thank you.",Success,"The recipe uses mixed beans (canned with their cooking liquid), toasted cumin, dill, fenugreek, black sesame, dried chilies, curry leaves, and spices including garam masala, turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg, all sautéed in coconut oil and combined with spiced tofu (or optional chicken) before simmering for 5–10 minutes. A caffeine‑free rooibos tea blend (containing cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, and nutmeg) is incorporated for flavor and is highlighted as easily ingestible. The final dish is finished with a sprinkle of garam masala, served hot with optional torn bread, and is described as vegan, gluten‑free, and dairy‑free when bread is omitted.

Peppermint tea infused lamb and tzatziki recipe – S01E07,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADbG28-tP1E," Music Today I thought I might use this Dilma peppermint leaves with Ceylon cinnamon. To make this I'm basically doing some curry powder, raisins, a little bit more cinnamon, onion, garlic and ginger. That's it. Olive oil to start, going to fry that. But first I want to make one of the accompaniments and that is a tzatziki. So I've got some great yogurt, it's just Greek style yogurt, nice and thick and rich. A little bit of diced cucumber, a small amount of raw garlic, which adds a really nice flavour to the tzatziki and some black pepper. Also a little lemon juice and that'll add some light to the dish itself and to the accompaniment. Now for crunch, I'm going to do something a little bit different and use some apple But this first has to be mixed up and then a couple of tea bags of the tea and let it infuse now which oil you use is up to you i'm using olive oil a nice amount get it nice and hot and then we're going to cook all of these ingredients the oil is starting to smoke i'm going I'm gonna add the onions, garlic and ginger. Stir that around a little bit. Add my curry leaves, just tear them in half. I'll pop a bit, so watch out. Cook this three to five minutes until it becomes golden. All right, so it's starting to color really nicely. Just lightly, it doesn't have to be dark brown, but become aromatic and lots of flavor coming out of it. Now I'm going to add a little bit of cinnamon, but also two bags of this peppermint tea Next will be some curry powder Doesn have to be anything special no fanciness just nice curry powder Some raisins they going to add the sweetness to balance the curry powder. A little bit of salt. And when the curry becomes fragrant, that's the time to add the lamb. And the reason for that is so that you end up with a really beautiful toasty curry flavor, not just out of the packet, raw curry flavor. Okay, so half a kilo of lamb. And it's important when you're doing this in the initial stages to break the lamb down, really mix it through, because this will ensure that when you do cook it, all the meat will be totally separate. So what I've done is made a little salad here. It's got a bit of mint in it and just some lettuce and then apple. Now apple's gonna add a beautiful flavour and texture to it as well. Time to assemble So pizza bread cut in half and opened up like nice pockets So firstly you need to pack it with your lettuce and then some apple a little bit of the lamb put it on top. Okay and then lastly this tzatziki with the peppermint inside it. I would say this half a kilo of lamb will be enough for at least two or three hungry people. That's it. Look, a really tasty, simple pita bread. Tea is inside, not just the lamb, but also in the tzatziki, but it goes. It's peppermint going with lamb. Perfect. Have a cup of tea with it and this will make the perfect brunch. Enjoy. Have a great week!",Success,"The recipe combines half a kilogram of lamb with olive oil, onion, garlic, ginger, curry leaves, Ceylon cinnamon, curry powder, raisins, salt, and two bags of peppermint tea, cooking the mixture until aromatic before adding the meat and breaking it up to keep pieces separate. A tzatziki accompaniment is made from thick Greek yogurt, diced cucumber, raw garlic, black pepper, lemon juice, and infused peppermint tea. Apple slices, mint, lettuce, and the lamb mixture are packed into halved pizza‑style pita pockets, topped with the peppermint‑flavored tzatziki. The dish yields enough portions for two to three people and is presented as a simple brunch option."
How to make Tea Infused Chocolate Pudding with Rooibos Tea – S01E05,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL07ObgXK_Y," Music Hi I'm Peter Kouravita and today I'm going to make for you an amazing chocolate pudding. Very simple, simple ingredients. Butter, chocolate, cocoa powder, plain flour, caster sugar and then three egg yolks and three whole egg. little interesting bit of this is the tea that I'm going to use to cook this with. Dilma has produced a tea, a rooibos tea, and this one has chocolate, turmeric, ginger and almond. So what I'm going to do is infuse the infusion into the chocolate. First I need to melt the chocolate with the butter and the cocoa powder and of course the tea. Look at the colour of the turmeric and the ginger and the rooibos, everything is visible here and it's going to add such a wonderful flavour into my pudding. Now that goes on to the heat over of what's called a bain-marie which is basically a hot water bath to melt. The chocolate and the cocoa and the butter will all come together and while it's heating, the tea will brew and all those flavours from the tea will come out as well And in the meantime we need to get the other side ready which is whipping the eggs Into the bowl I going to put the whole eggs and also the egg yolks And then just give it a little beat so that it mixes together to start off with, and then slowly add the sugar. Once the egg breaks up, then you can start adding the sugar. Turn it up full blast. And get back to this. You can see how it's starting to melt now. Just keep stirring it that way. There won't be any lumps and it'll be nicely infused. Alright, see how it's all coming together? And the tea, because rooibos tea, three to five minutes to brew. So in this three to five minutes that it takes to melt all of the chocolate and the butter, the tea itself is brewing and adding all of those wonderful flavours through it. So we're nearly there. Nice and shiny, it's glistening. Okay so now the eggs and the sugar are creamed as they say. Turn it off. When you read something that says it should be in ribbons, it means if you get the bowl and you do that it stays as one piece in ribbons. Now that that done I going to add the chocolate and I going to put this back on because it nice and hot So it going to partially cook the egg Now we don't have to beat it quickly because we've added all the air into this mixture. I don't want to be beating it and knocking down the air because the chocolate's heavy, the butter's heavy. And if you do whip it too much, you're going to end up with a very flat, airless cake, which is not what we want. Okay, that's it. Bring it out and then the rest will be done manually. Now folding means to go underneath and turn it over. See that? I'm going underneath and turning it and that way making sure that everything is incorporated but not knocking the air out of it. Once I've got that all combined, then the flour gets added a little at a time. Sift it in so that it's nice and light. Get it really nicely mixed. But now I've got this rich, luscious cream chocolate, which I'm going to now put into the moulds, which have been pre-greased into an oven for 160 degrees for 12 to 20 minutes. So if you have a smaller mold, probably 12 minutes, but as this mold is larger, I going to cook it a lot longer Okay divide it evenly I get my taster in in a second and he can taste it hey taj you want to uh lick the bowl go for it that's one way to do the cleaning that's for sure okay so these go into a oven that's 160 degrees for between 12 and 20 minutes because these are large i'm going to make it 18 minutes We'll see, we'll check it after that. 20 minutes is up. They're ready now and they're beautiful. All right, so you can see they're beautiful. They've risen a little bit, they're still soft and they'll be moist on the center. So if you've greased this container very well, they should just slide out. Let's hope. There we go, look at that. And now the center of this little baby should still be slightly runny and yes it is so let's serve this with some fresh raspberries a little bit of cream so uh give it a try at home it's always fantastic and look can't wait to eat it you",Success,"Peter Kouravita demonstrates a chocolate pudding recipe that uses butter, chocolate, cocoa powder, plain flour, caster sugar, three egg yolks and three whole eggs, and a rooibos tea blend from Dilma containing chocolate, turmeric, ginger and almond. The chocolate, butter, cocoa and tea infusion are melted together in a bain‑marie while the tea brews for three to five minutes, then combined with a creamed mixture of eggs and sugar, folded with sifted flour, and poured into pre‑greased molds. The molds are baked in a 160 °C oven for 12–20 minutes (approximately 18 minutes for larger molds) until the puddings are risen, soft and slightly runny in the centre. The finished puddings are served with fresh raspberries and cream."

And to me, green tea and seafood are a match made in heaven. That's where I'm starting. I'm starting with some beautiful salmon, a little bit of green tea, and then a dukkah mix. I found a dukkah mix in the supermarket. It's got pepitas, it's got lots of flavor, garlic, some onion salt, garlic salt. So that itself will be delicious. And that's all I'm going to do. Very easy to prepare. Get a nice heavy pan onto the stove and get it smoking. smoking. Okay so first I'm going to crush up this tea. It's big large pieces of tea mixed up with my dukkah mixture, a little bit of salt and then just thoroughly combined so that when it sticks to the fish it's going to be a little bit of everything. Now I've got a little bit of soy sauce which I'm going to brush on this on the fish and that'll be the glue. I'm going to add my oil to the pan, ensure that it becomes nice and hot and then take the fish. Now this fish has the skin on which is also lovely because crispy skin fish is beautiful as it is. Coat it nicely with your mixture and then when you place it into the pan, move it away from yourself so that you don't burn yourself. Again, shake Take the mixture up dab it make sure it beautifully coated and then put it into the pan away from yourself Keep the pan really hot and let it cook Now there a couple of secrets here to know how to make medium rare fish and that is by seeing the white line that's starting to rise on the fish. When it gets to a third of the way, it's time to turn the fish and by then the skin should be crispy too. Now the colour has risen to a third of the way up. Gently scrape the fish off the bottom, not damaging the skin at all, and then gently flip it. You have this beautiful golden brown colour on the skin of the fish. Same with the other one. And what we're doing here is basically just toasting all that dukkha and the tea and everything, and the flavours are gonna go into this be absolutely fantastic. About three minutes and I can plate it up. Okay. They'll get the skin at the bottom. Perfect. Now again, there's tea on this, but I would strongly recommend that you have this piece of fish with the Dilma Jasmine and Green Tea because what it does is it helps emulsify the fats. So as you eat this with the salad, you're going to have great enjoyment but while you drink the tea it'll help your digestion make you healthier the health-giving benefits of Dilma tea come through again so enjoy you",Success,"The recipe combines salmon fillets with a coating of crushed jasmine green tea, dukkah mix (pepitas, garlic, onion salt, garlic salt), a pinch of salt, and brushed soy sauce, then pan‑sears the skin‑on fish in hot oil until the skin is crispy and the interior reaches medium‑rare, indicated by a white line rising one‑third up the fillet. The pan is kept very hot; the fish is flipped after the skin browns and cooked an additional three minutes.

How to cook devilled chicken and pair it with tea – S01E01,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGLG5CkcNic," This is an amazing dish. It's one of Sri Lanka's favourite dishes and I'm not putting tea in it, but I'm pairing it with one of Dilma's most beautiful teas. You see it everywhere in the supermarkets, the Dilma extra strength tea gives you that extra bit of oomph in your tea and when you've got spices, black tea or milk tea goes so well with them. So rather than infusing it, I'm pairing. What we're gonna do is make deviled chicken paired with Dilma extra strength tea. Yeah it's good. Here's the list of simple ingredients. Some chicken thigh fillet, some tomatoes, some leek, a combination of capsicums or peppers, onion, garlic, the onion cut into large pieces, and then some chilli, curry leaves, and my special deviled sauce, which is very simple. It's tomato sauce with vinegar, and then some salt and pepper. Simple. Start with some coconut oil into a hot pan. When it starts to smoke and not before, you can add your chicken to it. Right. My pan, as you can see, is smoking. So gently, without splashing yourself, add the chicken. But what I will do is season a little bit now, just with some salt, black pepper. So let this cook. We just need to keep turning it gently. Let it get really hot, turn it again, and when it goes nice and brown, we'll add everything else. All right, I've been stirring this for five minutes. The pan has cooled down a little bit, but I've managed to get some color onto it, which is good. Now I going to add curry leaves torn chopped green chili then the onion and the garlic and this we just going to cook down now I don want the onion to be too soft What I'm doing here now is just stirring it around until it becomes a little bit fragrant. The onions break up a little bit and now my peppers and then I'm going to add my tomatoes. So tossing it, you push it to the front and pull it back. Now my sweet and sour sauce. I've used some apple cider vinegar and tomato sauce. Bring that up to the boil. It's ready to serve and we'll serve it with a cup of beautiful Dilma extra strength tea. Alright If you look into here, the sauce is really thick. The tomatoes are starting to break down, but the colors are still fantastic. The important thing is to make sure the chicken's cooked, which it is, and then we're gonna serve this. Just garnish it a little bit with some nice greenery, some shallots. But paired with the Dilma Extra Strength tea, and with this one I have milk in it, I think spice and black tea, or spice and strong tea, go really well together. So this is an afternoon snack for you. Share a cup of beautiful Dilma extra strength tea with my deviled chicken. I hope you enjoy it. tossed off, gone mad or more or less than a Nooday guy.",Success,"The recipe prepares deviled chicken using chicken thigh fillets, coconut oil, and a sauce of tomato sauce, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper, combined with tomatoes, leek, capsicums, onion, garlic, green chili, and curry leaves.

I told Marley all about how our mixologists actually infuse tea into alcohol. And so we've learned that. And that is basically two or three teabags into 300 mils of whatever liquor you would like. But generally white liquor or something that doesn't have too much flavor. And then in this stage, we're going to add vodka. And over the period of us making this cocktail, you'll see how tea infuses into liquor. This is what the brew looks like. It's a beautiful tea, absolutely lovely to drink. But when you put it into liquor and cold infuse for 45 minutes, you end up with something very similar. Look, already it's starting to brew. The colour is slowly changing. So while I agitate that, Mali, what are you going to make us? So we're going to make a French martini. So first it's one shot of Chambord, which is a raspberry liqueur. Yeah. The aromas are coming through. And there will be one and a half shots of the vodka and tea infusion. So you can see the colour of that already It really dark and that 45 minutes cold brew And next will be a double shot of pineapple juice Nice. Pineapple juice is beautiful. And then to give it a good froth, just about half a shot or roughly a tablespoon of chickpea juice. So if you're a vegetarian, if you're a vegan, if you're a bit health conscious about using raw egg white, Watch what chickpea juice does to a cocktail. So then you top up your shaves with ice. Shakes. Looks good. So then you serve French martini in a martini glass. How frothy is that? That's amazing, isn't it? Better than an egg white. Excellent, Marley. Well done. Well there you go. You can do this at home. Cold brew your tea into white spirits or even dark spirits and then you can make a cocktail like this at home. Well done Marley. Good job. What are you gonna garnish it with? Just some rose petals. Nice. Very nice. There you go. Simple, easy. Thanks. We'll see you next time.",Success,"Peter Kurovita and Mali Kurovita demonstrate how to cold‑infuse Dilma tea into liquor by steeping two to three tea bags in 300 ml of a neutral spirit (typically vodka or another white liquor) for 45 minutes. They use the resulting tea‑infused vodka to prepare a French martini composed of one shot Chambord raspberry liqueur, 1.5 shots of the tea‑infused vodka, a double shot of pineapple juice, and approximately one tablespoon of chickpea juice as a vegan frothing agent. The cocktail is shaken with ice, strained into a martini glass, and garnished with rose petals. The method can be applied to both white and dark spirits for home cocktail preparation."
